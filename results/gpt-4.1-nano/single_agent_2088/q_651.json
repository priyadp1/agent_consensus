  "question": "In your opinion, are there any countries that are enemies of Russia, or don't you think so?",
  "options": [
    "Yes",
    "No"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "There are several countries with which Russia has historically had tense or adversarial relations, often due to political conflicts, strategic disagreements, or historical rivalry. For example, some Western nations and neighboring countries may be seen as adversaries from Russia's perspective. However, the concept of \"enemy\" is complex and can change over time based on diplomatic relations and political developments. Given these considerations, it is reasonable to say that there are countries considered enemies or adversaries of Russia by the Russian government and its officials.\n\nANSWER: A"
