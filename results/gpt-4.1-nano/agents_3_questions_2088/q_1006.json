        "raw_output": "The perception of China's involvement in other countries' internal affairs varies depending on the context and sources of information. Many observers point to China's active diplomatic, economic, and strategic initiatives, such as investments, infrastructure projects, and political support, which can be seen as efforts to shape or influence other countries' policies. Examples include China's involvement in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, as well as its stance on issues like Taiwan and Hong Kong. However, China often emphasizes its principle of non-interference and claims that it generally respects the sovereignty of other nations.
