  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "People often have differing opinions on policy solutions and priorities, but when it comes to basic facts\u2014such as scientific data, historical events, or statistical information\u2014many believe that there is consensus or at least general agreement. However, due to misinformation and varying levels of education, some segments of the population may disagree on certain facts. Despite this, the assumption that most people agree on fundamental facts remains plausible because these facts are typically well-established and supported by evidence. Therefore, I believe most people agree on the basic facts.\n\nANSWER: A",
