Such practices can be considered inhumane and violate principles of justice and dignity. Moreover, modern legal systems tend to favor rehabilitation over corporal punishment, and international human rights standards generally oppose cruel and unusual punishments. Therefore, I believe that punishing adultery should be approached through fair legal procedures that respect individual rights, rather than through violent and publicly degrading methods like stoning.\n\nANSWER: B",
