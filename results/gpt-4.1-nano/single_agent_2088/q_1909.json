  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that maintaining a military presence could help stabilize the security situation and prevent the resurgence of extremist groups.

Given the need for stability and building sustainable peace, I think keeping troops until conditions are sufficiently stabilized is prudent.\n\nANSWER: A",
