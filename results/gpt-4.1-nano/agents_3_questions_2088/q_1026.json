        "raw_output": "The perception of the U.S. government's stance on democracy in the Middle East is complex and often debated. Historically, the U.S. has supported democratic movements in some instances, but its strategic interests and foreign policies sometimes appear to prioritize stability or alliances over democratic principles. There are cases where actions suggest opposition to democracy, such as supporting authoritarian regimes, or actions that undermine democratic institutions. Conversely, there are also moments where the U.S. public and officials have expressed support for democratic development in the region. Given this mixed record, it's difficult to categorize the overall stance as solely supportive or opposed; perceptions vary depending on specific policies, time periods, and perspectives. Therefore, I believe the answer is both/neither as the situation encompasses a spectrum of actions and policies.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The U.S. government's position toward democracy in the Middle East has been complex and varied over time, often influenced by strategic interests, regional stability, and diplomatic priorities. Historically, there have been instances where the U.S. has supported democratic movements, such as in selectively endorsing democratic elections or promoting civil society initiatives. At the same time, there are documented cases where the U.S. has prioritized alliances with authoritarian regimes or has been cautious about supporting democratic uprisings that could threaten strategic interests. Given this nuanced record, it is difficult to categorically say the government either consistently favors or opposes democracy in the region. Therefore, the most accurate reflection of the overall stance is that it embodies a mix of both, depending on specific circumstances and policies.\n\nANSWER: C",

While there have been efforts to support democratic movements and institutions, there have also been instances where strategic interests led to tacit or direct support for authoritarian regimes. This mixed record suggests that the U.S. does not uniformly favor or oppose democracy, but rather acts based on specific geopolitical considerations, which can sometimes be perceived as opposing or supporting democracy depending on the context. Therefore, many would argue that the stance is neither entirely one nor the other, but fluctuates depending on circumstances.\n\nANSWER: C",
