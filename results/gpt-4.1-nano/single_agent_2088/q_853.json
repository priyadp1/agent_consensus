    "Hinduism",
    "None (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "E",
  "raw_output": "I believe that none of the religions listed should be categorized as most violent, as violence exists in various forms across many societies and is often driven by political, social, or economic factors rather than religion itself. While certain actions or periods in history have involved violence associated with these religions, they are primarily rooted in their teachings of compassion, peace, and spiritual growth. Therefore, I choose the option that indicates none.\n\nANSWER: E"
