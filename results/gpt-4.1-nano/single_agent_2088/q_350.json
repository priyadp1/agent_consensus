  "raw_output": "The increasing use of the Internet can have both positive and negative effects on morality. On the one hand, it provides access to a vast amount of information and promotes awareness about ethical issues, which can enhance moral understanding. On the other hand, it also facilitates the spread of harmful content, unethical behaviors, and can encourage misconduct, thereby potentially eroding moral values. Overall, I believe the influence varies depending on individual choices and societal controls, but the potential for negative impact seems significant. Therefore, I perceive it as having a generally bad influence on morality.\n\nANSWER: B"
