  "question": "Overall, how much influence do you think Turkey is having on the way things are going in your country? Would you say it is having a great deal of influence, a fair amount, not too much, or no influence at all? (Ask if 'A great deal' or 'A fair amount':) Is this a good thing, a bad thing, or neither good nor bad? ",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad",
    "Neither"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe Turkey's influence on my country is moderate, which suggests it's neither overwhelmingly positive nor negative. Given this, I view this influence as neither inherently good nor bad; it likely depends on specific circumstances and outcomes. Therefore, I think that the influence isn't necessarily beneficial or harmful overall, but rather neutral in its impact. \n\nANSWER: C"
