        "raw_output": "I tend to trust European standards more when it comes to data privacy because the European Union has implemented comprehensive legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which sets strict rules and enforcement mechanisms for protecting individuals' privacy rights. In contrast, American standards often vary across states and sectors, with less uniform federal regulation, leading to perceptions of weaker privacy protections overall.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I tend to trust European standards more when it comes to data privacy because they have implemented comprehensive regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which sets strict rules for data protection and privacy. These regulations prioritize individual rights and have a global influence, often serving as a benchmark for privacy standards worldwide. Conversely, American standards are generally more business-friendly and rely on a patchwork of laws that can vary by state and sector, often giving less emphasis to individual privacy. Therefore, I personally feel more confident in European standards for safeguarding data privacy.\n\nANSWER: A",
