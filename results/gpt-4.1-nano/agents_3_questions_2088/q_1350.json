        "raw_output": "Granting Muslim leaders and religious judges the authority to decide family and property disputes can have both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, it may provide culturally appropriate and faith-based resolution mechanisms that respect religious traditions. On the other hand, it could raise concerns about fairness, especially in diverse societies that uphold principles of secular justice and gender equality. Considering these factors, I might oppose such an extension of religious authority to ensure that disputes are resolved according to equitable secular laws that apply uniformly to all citizens, regardless of religious affiliation. This approach helps safeguard individual rights and promotes social cohesion in pluralistic societies.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Allowing Muslim leaders and religious judges to decide family and property disputes can be beneficial in communities where religious law aligns with cultural practices and the majority's values. They often have deep understanding of religious laws and local customs, which can lead to fair and culturally sensitive resolutions. However, it may also raise concerns about neutrality, the protection of individual rights, and the consistency of legal standards if such decisions are not overseen by a secular legal framework. Balancing respect for religious practices with the need for fair, unbiased justice in diverse societies suggests a cautious approach. Therefore, I oppose empowering religious bodies to make these decisions without appropriate checks and balances.\n\nANSWER: B",
