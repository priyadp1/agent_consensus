        "raw_output": "I believe China considers international interests to some extent, especially as it seeks to expand its global influence and participate in multilateral organizations. However, its primary focus tends to be on advancing its own national interests, often leading to a perception that it does not prioritize other countries' interests as much as some might expect. Therefore, I would select a moderate response that reflects this balance.\n\nANSWER: B",

While China certainly considers its own strategic and economic objectives, it also engages in diplomacy and international cooperation, which suggests it factors in global interests to some degree. However, the extent might not reach a great deal, as national priorities often dominate. Therefore, I would choose B.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it engages with the international community and considers some global perspectives, its decision-making often reflects its national interests more strongly than a genuine concern for global consensus.

While China undoubtedly prioritizes its own strategic and economic objectives, it also actively engages in diplomatic efforts and international cooperation, which indicates some level of consideration for global interests.
