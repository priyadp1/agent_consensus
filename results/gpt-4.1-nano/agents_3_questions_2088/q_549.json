        "raw_output": "I believe that lower income groups tend to have too much influence in our political system. This is because they often mobilize strongly around issues directly affecting their livelihoods, and their votes can sway elections in ways that prioritize short-term relief over long-term solutions. Additionally, political campaigns often rely on fundraising from wealthy donors, which can skew influence toward higher-income interests rather than the grassroots. While their voices are important, the current system sometimes disproportionately amplifies the concerns of lower-income populations beyond what might be equitable, overshadowing the broader interests of society. Therefore, the influence of lower income groups seems to be excessive relative to their overall representation and resources compared to other segments of society.\n\nANSWER: A",
