On the other hand, there is a significant concern about their tendency to cause civilian casualties, which can undermine moral and ethical standards, as well as public support. Therefore, I think that the risk of killing innocent people is too high and should be minimized through stricter controls and accountability measures.\n\nANSWER: A",

While national security is important, the potential for collateral damage suggests that these strikes often kill too many innocent people, making them problematic from a moral standpoint.
