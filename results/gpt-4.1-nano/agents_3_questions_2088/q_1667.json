        "raw_output": "I believe that the Mexican government is losing ground in its campaign against drug traffickers because despite ongoing efforts, violence and drug-related crimes continue to be widespread. The complexity of entrenched criminal networks and corruption suggests that significant progress has not yet been achieved, and challenges persist that hinder effective control. Therefore, it seems that the situation remains as difficult as it has been in the past.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Based on my understanding of recent developments and ongoing challenges in Mexico's efforts against drug traffickers, it appears that while there have been some successes, the overall situation remains complex and persistent issues continue. The government has made efforts to crackdown on traffickers and reduce violence, but many problems still persist, indicating that they are not significantly ahead but also not losing ground entirely. Therefore, I believe that the situation remains about the same as in the past.\n\nANSWER: C",

While some initiatives may have had limited success, overall progress seems sluggish, and the problem continues to evolve in a complicated manner. Therefore, it seems that the government is not gaining ground but rather struggling to make a substantial difference.\n\nANSWER: B",
