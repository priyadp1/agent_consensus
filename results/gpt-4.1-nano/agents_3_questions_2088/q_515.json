        "raw_output": "I believe that the differences between our country and the United States primarily stem from differing values. Values form the foundational beliefs and cultural principles that shape a society's identity and influence long-term attitudes, behaviors, and priorities. While policies can be influenced or changed over time, they are often a reflection of underlying values. Therefore, these core differences are more rooted in the fundamental principles each society upholds. That said, policies can also reflect these values, so the two are interconnected, but the core driver tends to be the underlying values.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "In my view, the primary reason for differences between our country and the United States often lies in underlying values. Values shape societal attitudes, cultural norms, and long-term perspectives, which influence policies but are more fundamental. While policies can differ due to political decisions, economic circumstances, or leadership, these are typically reflections of deeper value systems. Therefore, when differences exist, they generally originate from differing core values rather than just policy choices.\n\nANSWER: A",

Values influence how societies prioritize issues, their traditions, and their worldview, leading to longstanding differences.

Values underpin cultural identities and influence the development of policies, which are often manifestations of deeper societal principles.
