        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that President Dilma Rousseff's approach to addressing poverty showed both efforts and challenges. Her administration focused on social welfare programs like Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, which aimed to lift many out of poverty and reduce inequality. However, economic difficulties and political controversies also hampered her ability to sustain and expand these initiatives effectively. Therefore, my overall view is somewhat mixed, leaning towards disapproval given the persistent issues and reforms needed to truly alleviate poverty on a broader scale.\n\nANSWER: B",

While her government has implemented social programs like Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, which helped reduce poverty levels, critics argue that these efforts were not sufficient to create sustainable economic growth and long-term improvements for the most vulnerable populations. Additionally, economic challenges and political controversies during her tenure impacted her ability to effectively handle poverty in a comprehensive manner.
