While globalization and technological advancements have played a role in economic shifts, the primary drivers include policies favoring the wealthy, tax systems, educational disparities, and access to opportunities that benefit the already privileged. These systemic issues have contributed more significantly to the widening inequality than the degree of global connectivity alone.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe the changing gap between rich and poor people is mostly due to other reasons rather than the increased connectivity of the world. While globalization and technological advances have provided more opportunities, they have largely benefited those who are already economically advantaged, leading to increased inequality. Factors such as government policies, tax systems, labor market changes, and economic structures play a more significant role in widening the income gap. Therefore, the primary reasons are rooted in economic and social policies rather than just the interconnectedness of the world.\n\nANSWER: B",

While globalization and technological advancements have played roles, systemic issues such as economic policies, inheritance laws, educational disparities, and unequal opportunities are more directly responsible for widening income gaps. Increased connectivity can sometimes exacerbate disparities if benefits are unevenly distributed, but it is not the main driver; deeper structural factors are at play.\n\nANSWER: B",

While globalization and technological changes\u2014which increase connectivity\u2014can influence economic dynamics, they are not the primary causes of income inequality. Often, these factors can even widen disparities if benefits are unevenly distributed, but the root causes lie in deeper societal and policy issues.
