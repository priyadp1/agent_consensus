        "raw_output": "If Iraq helped the terrorists attack the United States on September 11th, it would directly relate to national security and the way threat levels are assessed. Such a connection would suggest a significant risk to U.S. safety and could justify military action as a means of preventing future attacks. Given the gravity of the September 11th attacks and the importance of protecting citizens from imminent or ongoing threats, this reason would be considered very important in justifying military force.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "If Iraq helped terrorists attack the United States on September 11th, it would significantly threaten national security and directly connect Iraq to an act of terrorism on U.S. soil. This would create a pressing justification for military action, seen as addressing an imminent threat and holding Iraq responsible for harboring or supporting terrorists. Therefore, this reason would be considered very important in justifying military force against Iraq.\n\nANSWER: A",

This connection would strongly justify military intervention, as it would imply involvement in a major terrorist attack against the U.S., raising the stakes for justification of military force.
