  "raw_output": "Promoting democracy in other nations is an important value for many people, but prioritizing it over other foreign policy goals can vary depending on circumstances and perspectives. Some may see it as a top priority because democracy can lead to stability and peace, while others might consider it a lower priority if immediate national interests or security are more pressing. Given the complexity, I believe it should be given some priority but not necessarily the highest. \n\nANSWER: B",
