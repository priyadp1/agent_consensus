  "question": "In your opinion, which one of the following is causing the most harm to our economy - Western sanctions, falling oil prices or current government economic policies? ",
  "options": [
    "Western sanctions",
    "Falling oil prices",
    "Current government economic policies",
    "None of these (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that current government economic policies are causing the most harm to our economy because policy decisions directly influence fiscal stability, investment climate, and long-term growth prospects. Poor or inconsistent policies can undermine economic confidence, lead to inflation or recession, and hinder development, making them more detrimental than external factors like sanctions or oil prices. While sanctions and oil prices do pose challenges, the government's approach often determines how effectively the economy can adapt or recover from these external shocks.\n\nANSWER: C",
