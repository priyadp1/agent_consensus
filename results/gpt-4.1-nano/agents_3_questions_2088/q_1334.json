        "raw_output": "The European Union's response to the coronavirus outbreak has been widely debated. While some members coordinated efforts for vaccine distribution and economic support, the EU faced criticism for delays in vaccine procurement and challenges in managing member states' differing approaches. Overall, the organization struggled to present a unified and highly effective response, but it also played a significant role in coordinating efforts and providing support. Considering these factors, I think the EU's performance was mixed but leaned more towards moderate effectiveness rather than strongly positive or negative.\n\nANSWER: B",
