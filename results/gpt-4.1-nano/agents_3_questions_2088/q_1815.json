        "raw_output": "I believe that the second statement is closer to my views. I think that crime is a complex issue influenced by multiple factors, and attributing it primarily to immigrants can oversimplify the problem. While some might argue that immigrants may be involved in crimes at higher rates, I think it's important to consider socioeconomic factors, community support, and law enforcement practices rather than blame a group solely based on their immigrant status. Therefore, I lean towards the view that blaming immigrants more than other groups isn't accurate or fair.\n\nANSWER: B",

While some might hold stereotypes or assumptions, I don't think any group is more responsible than others, and crime is influenced by many complex social factors.

Focusing blame on a particular group can be unfair and oversimplifies the problem. Therefore, I do not agree that immigrants are more to blame for crime than other groups, nor do I think that the first statement (which might be a different perspective) accurately represents my views. The most appropriate choice is that neither statement reflects my opinion.\n\nANSWER: C",

The second statement suggests that blame is overly simplified if attributed primarily to immigrants, which aligns with my view that it's unfair to single out immigrants in this context. Therefore, I choose the option that indicates neither group is chiefly responsible, or that blaming immigrants more than others isn't justified.\n\nANSWER: C",

I recognize that crime is a complex problem influenced by various socioeconomic factors, and blaming a particular group can be unfair and misleading.
