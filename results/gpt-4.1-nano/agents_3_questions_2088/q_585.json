Western societies are diverse, and many individuals demonstrate altruism and community-oriented behaviors. While some personal actions may be perceived as selfish, it is unfair to generalize an entire population with this trait.

People in Western countries are diverse, with many exhibiting altruism, kindness, and community-minded behavior. While there may be some cultural contexts where individualism is prominent, it does not inherently mean that all Western individuals are selfish.
