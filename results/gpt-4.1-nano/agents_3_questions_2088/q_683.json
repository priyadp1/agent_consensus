        "raw_output": "The recognition of the referendum results by the government in Kiev depends on the legitimacy and international acceptance of the process. Many countries and international organizations have questioned the fairness and legality of the March 16th referendum, citing issues such as lack of proper oversight and potential coercion. Recognizing such results unconditionally could undermine international law and set a precedent for unilateral moves that disrupt regional stability. Therefore, it is advisable for the government in Kiev to refrain from recognizing the results until proper, internationally accepted processes are established to ensure fairness and legality.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The recognition of the referendum results is a highly complex and sensitive issue involving international law, sovereignty, and regional stability. Many countries and international organizations regard the referendum held in Crimea as illegitimate because it was conducted under circumstances that did not meet the usual standards of fairness and transparency, and without the consent of the Ukrainian government. Recognizing such results could set a precedent for unilateral changes to borders that undermine international norms. Therefore, I believe the government should not recognize the results to uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nANSWER: B",

While some argue that respecting the referendum's outcome could reduce tensions, others believe that such a move might undermine Ukraine's territorial integrity and violate principles of law. Given the controversial and internationally disputed nature of the referendum, the government in Kiev should prioritize adherence to legal norms and diplomatic avenues rather than unilaterally recognizing results that lack broad international legitimacy.\n\nANSWER: B",
