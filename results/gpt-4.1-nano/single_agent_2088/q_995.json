  "question": "According to news reports, the American government has been monitoring communications, such as emails and phone calls, in the U.S. and many other countries. In your opinion, is it acceptable or unacceptable for the American government to monitor communications from...your nationality citizens?",
  "options": [
    "Acceptable",
    "Unacceptable"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that monitoring communications can be acceptable if it is done securely and with proper oversight to prevent misuse, especially in cases of national security threats. However, it becomes unacceptable if such surveillance infringes on individual privacy rights without sufficient oversight or transparency. Balancing security concerns with personal privacy is crucial, but overall, I think that respecting citizens' privacy should take precedence unless there's a significant justification to monitor. \n\nANSWER: A",
