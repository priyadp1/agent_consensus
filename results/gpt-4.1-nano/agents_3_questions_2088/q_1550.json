        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The concern about China\u2019s human rights policies being a problem for the U.S. is significant because it touches on moral and ethical issues, as well as international reputation and diplomatic relations. If the U.S. perceives China's human rights record as severe, it can influence foreign policy, economic sanctions, and public opinion. Given the importance of human rights in international relations, I think this is at least somewhat serious, but perhaps not the most immediate or urgent issue compared to other national priorities. Therefore, it seems appropriate to rate it as a serious concern but not the topmost issue.\n\nANSWER: B",

Many Americans and policymakers view these human rights violations as a serious problem that undermines ethical standards and could have broader implications for global stability and U.S. values. While some may see it as less urgent compared to other economic or security issues, overall, it remains a prominent and serious concern in shaping U.S. foreign policy and public opinion.\n\nANSWER: A",

Addressing human rights is crucial but may not always be seen as the top priority in broader foreign policy decisions.
