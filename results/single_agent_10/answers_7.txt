Question 7
Please tell me which of the following is closest to your own opinion. Less inefficient large enterprises is helpful for economic improvement OR Less inefficient large enterprises is not helpful for economic development

I believe that less inefficient large enterprises are helpful for economic development. When large enterprises operate more efficiently, they can produce more value with fewer resources, contribute positively to innovation, and create a more competitive market. Improving their efficiency can lead to higher productivity, job creation, and overall economic growth, which benefits the broader economy. Therefore, making large enterprises less inefficient is a positive step toward economic improvement.
