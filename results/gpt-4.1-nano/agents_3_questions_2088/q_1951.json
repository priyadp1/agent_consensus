When too few citizens engage in political activities, it can undermine the legitimacy of government, hinder representation, and reduce accountability. In many countries, low participation rates are seen as a significant issue that can lead to apathy, disillusionment, and a lack of diverse viewpoints in policymaking. Therefore, I consider this a very big problem because addressing it is essential for a healthy and vibrant democracy.\n\nANSWER: A",
