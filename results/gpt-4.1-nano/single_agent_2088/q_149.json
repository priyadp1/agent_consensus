  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Based on current global dynamics, the U.S. and China are engaged in complex economic interactions characterized by both competition and cooperation. While there are areas of friction and concern over trade practices and tariffs, there are also significant economic ties and potential for collaboration. Overall, these relations seem to be more strained than constructive, but not entirely deteriorated to a very bad state. Therefore, I would classify them as somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C"
