  "raw_output": "The European Union's response to the coronavirus outbreak has been perceived differently across member states and observer opinions. While some appreciate the coordinated efforts and support provided, others feel that the response has been delayed or insufficient in certain areas, especially regarding vaccine distribution and economic aid. Overall, the EU's handling appears to be mixed, with notable strengths and weaknesses, which makes it difficult to categorize as either very good or very bad universally. Considering these nuances, a moderate assessment such as somewhat bad seems to reflect the general perception of its actions.\n\nANSWER: C",
