        "raw_output": "Over recent years, the relationship between Europe and the U.S. has experienced fluctuations due to differing policy priorities, diplomatic tensions, and global challenges like security issues and climate change. While certain areas have seen increased cooperation, especially in economic and security domains, other aspects, such as trade disagreements or differing geopolitical strategies, have caused some distancing. Overall, these complexities suggest that the basic interests have remained largely consistent, despite occasional disagreements and alignments. Therefore, I believe they have stayed about the same.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "In recent years, the interests of Europe and the U.S. have generally grown further apart due to differing perspectives on foreign policy, trade issues, and approaches to global crises. While there are still areas of cooperation, tensions and divergences have increased, especially during certain political administrations and responses to international events. This divergence reflects the complex nature of transatlantic relations and evolving national priorities.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there have been disagreements on specific policies, such as trade, defense commitments, and foreign interventions, overall, both sides have tended to maintain strong diplomatic and economic ties. Many analysts suggest that despite temporary differences, the fundamental interests\u2014like security, economic stability, and democratic values\u2014have kept the relationship relatively steady. Therefore, it seems that the basic interests of Europe and the U.S. have remained about the same.\n\nANSWER: C",

While longstanding security and economic ties persist, the priorities and policies of each have shifted in ways that sometimes create tension or reduce alignment. Nonetheless, core shared values and mutual interests still serve as a foundation, preventing the relationship from becoming significantly more distant.
