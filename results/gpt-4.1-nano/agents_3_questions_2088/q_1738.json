        "raw_output": "I believe U.S. policies toward India and Pakistan tend to favor India somewhat due to strategic partnerships, economic interests, and regional influence, although efforts are made to support stability in both countries. However, at times, this might lead to perceptions of favoritism toward one side, which can complicate diplomatic relations. Overall, I think the policies are generally balanced but may lean slightly toward India more often. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that U.S. policies toward India and Pakistan aim to balance strategic interests with diplomatic considerations, but often they seem to favor India more due to strong economic ties, geopolitical alliances, and its larger influence in regional stability. While efforts are made to maintain fairness, the perceived tilt toward India can sometimes overshadow the importance of engaging and supporting Pakistan's stability and development. Therefore, I see the policies as leaning more toward favoring India than being entirely fair or favoring Pakistan.\n\nANSWER: B",
