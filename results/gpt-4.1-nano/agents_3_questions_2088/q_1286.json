While efforts are underway for transparency and accountability, entrenched interests and systemic issues could hinder significant improvements. Without substantial reforms or global cooperation, corruption risks persisting or increasing. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe corruption may persist or even worsen over the next five years because in many places, corruption is deeply embedded in political and economic systems. Without significant reforms and increased transparency, these issues are likely to continue or deteriorate. However, there is also hope that increased public awareness and international pressure could lead to improvements, but the current trends do not strongly suggest this will happen imminently.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe corruption is likely to get worse in the next five years because many countries face ongoing issues with transparency and governance, and efforts to combat corruption often lag behind the scale of the problem. Additionally, political and economic instability in some regions can exacerbate corruption rather than diminish it, making it unlikely to see significant improvement without substantial reforms. Therefore, I expect corruption to worsen rather than improve or stay the same.\n\nANSWER: C",

Without significant reforms or increased accountability measures, the entrenched nature of corruption makes improvement unlikely, especially amid ongoing political and economic instability.

Although efforts are being made to address corruption, systemic obstacles, entrenched interests, and political instability in some areas suggest that progress may be slow or insufficient. Without significant reforms and international collaboration, it seems likely that corruption could persist or increase rather than improve or stay the same.\n\nANSWER: C",
