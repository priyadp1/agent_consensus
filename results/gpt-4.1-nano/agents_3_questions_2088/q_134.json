Some may see deportation as necessary for maintaining lawful immigration processes, while others may oppose it due to humanitarian considerations or the potential negative impacts on communities. Personally, I tend to support policies that focus on humane and fair treatment, which may include pathways to legal status rather than immediate deportation, unless there are substantiated legal or safety concerns. Therefore, I lean more toward opposition, though I recognize that the issue is complex. \n\nANSWER: B",
