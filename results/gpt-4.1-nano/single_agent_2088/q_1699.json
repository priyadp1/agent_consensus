  "raw_output": "Michel Temer was a controversial figure in Brazilian politics, serving as president under tense circumstances and often facing criticism over corruption allegations and political decisions.

Given these mixed sentiments and the tendency of public opinion to lean toward skepticism of politicians involved in scandal, my assessment would lean toward a somewhat unfavorable opinion.\n\nANSWER: C",
