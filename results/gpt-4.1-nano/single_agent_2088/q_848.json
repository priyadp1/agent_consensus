  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Egypt has historically played a significant political and cultural role in the Middle East, and in recent years, its influence has been perceived to have increased due to its central position in regional diplomacy, stability efforts, and its size. This suggests that Egypt's role is now more prominent than it was a decade ago, especially given ongoing regional conflicts and political shifts that have placed greater emphasis on Egypt's position. Therefore, I believe Egypt now plays a more important role in the Middle East compared to 10 years ago.\n\nANSWER: A"
