        "raw_output": "I believe the second most concerning aspect of Islamic extremism in our country today is that it will lead to people having fewer personal freedoms and choices. While violence is a significant concern, the suppression of individual liberties could have a broader and longer-lasting impact on society, affecting daily life, personal development, and democratic values. The potential erosion of personal freedoms strikes a more profound chord as it pertains to the fundamental rights and freedoms that underpin our society.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "After considering the different concerns associated with Islamic extremism, I believe that it will divide the country is the next most concerning issue. This is because societal cohesion and unity are essential for stability and progress. When extremism leads to division, it can erode social trust, foster hostility, and create ongoing conflicts that are hard to resolve. Such division can also undermine collective efforts to address other issues like violence or economic development, making it a particularly troubling concern.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "After considering the options, I believe the concern that stands out as the next most significant is the potential for division within the country. While violence is a serious issue, the societal impact of division can have long-lasting effects on social cohesion, political stability, and community relations. These divisions could also indirectly impact economic development and personal freedoms over time, making it a deeply rooted concern that warrants attention. \n\nANSWER: C",

While violence is immediate and personal freedoms are crucial, the overarching consequence of division affects multiple facets of the country\u2019s stability and progress. Therefore, I see division as the most pressing concern among these options.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I consider the most pressing concern about Islamic extremism to be that it will set back economic development. Economic stability and growth are crucial for societal well-being and are often deeply impacted by extremism through instability, reduced investments, and diminished trust in institutions. While violence and social division are serious, economic setbacks can have cascading effects on personal freedoms, social cohesion, and overall national progress, making it a significant concern for the future of the country.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe the most significant concern about Islamic extremism in our country today is that it will lead to people having fewer personal freedoms and choices. While violence is undeniably serious, the erosion of individual liberties has a profound and lasting impact on society's core values and democratic principles. Limiting personal freedoms can suppress free expression, restrict lifestyle choices, and undermine the rights that enable a diverse and open society to flourish. Protecting personal freedoms is essential for maintaining a healthy, tolerant, and resilient community.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Considering the various implications of Islamic extremism, while violence directly threatens safety and personal well-being, the concern about societal cohesion and long-term stability seems more profound. Societal division can undermine trust, foster hostility, and potentially lead to conflict, which can be far more damaging over time than immediate acts of violence. Protecting the social fabric and unity appears crucial to prevent deeper long-term damage. Therefore, the most significant concern for me is the potential to divide the country.\n\nANSWER: C",

Social cohesion is fundamental to national stability, and division can lead to long-term polarization, mistrust, and conflict that undermines progress across multiple areas.
