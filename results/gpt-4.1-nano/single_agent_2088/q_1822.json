  "raw_output": "The U.S. trade deficit with China is often viewed as a significant economic concern because it might impact domestic manufacturing jobs and national economic balance. Many people perceive it as a serious issue because it can reflect unfair trade practices or economic dependency. However, some may see it as less critical, considering the benefits of cheaper imports and consumer choices. Given the potential economic and strategic implications, I believe it is a very serious problem for the U.S. that warrants attention and action.\n\nANSWER: A",
