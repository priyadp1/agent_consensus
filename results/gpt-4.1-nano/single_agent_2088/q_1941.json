  "raw_output": "In many families, decisions about household finances are often influenced by cultural norms, economic roles, and individual circumstances. Traditionally, in some societies, men tend to have more influence over financial decisions due to cultural expectations or main income earners. However, in other families, women may hold more influence, especially when they manage household budgets or are primary earners. Overall, the influence can vary widely, but many studies suggest that in contemporary contexts, men and women tend to share financial decision-making relatively equally. Therefore, I believe that generally, men and women have about the same influence in household financial decisions.\n\nANSWER: C",
