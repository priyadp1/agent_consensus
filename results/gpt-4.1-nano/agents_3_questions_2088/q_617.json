        "raw_output": "The removal of Saddam Hussein from power has led to significant changes in Iraq's political, social, and economic landscape. While his dictatorship provided a certain degree of stability and control, it also suppressed dissent and led to widespread human rights abuses. In the long run, the hopes are that Iraq will become more democratic, with increased freedoms and opportunities for its people. However, the country has faced challenges such as ongoing violence, political instability, and economic struggles, which complicate the prediction of an overall better future. If Iraq can navigate these hurdles, the long-term outlook could be positive, but there are also risks that it might deteriorate further without strong institutions and international support. Given these complexities, it is difficult to confidently declare a better future, but the potential for positive change exists.\n\nANSWER: A",
