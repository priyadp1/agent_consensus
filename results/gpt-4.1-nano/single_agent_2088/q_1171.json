  "raw_output": "Having an independent media that can report the news without government censorship is crucial for a healthy democracy. It ensures transparency, holds those in power accountable, and allows citizens to make informed decisions. Without freedom of the media, misinformation can spread, and the government may control narratives to serve its interests, which undermines trust and hampers social progress.
