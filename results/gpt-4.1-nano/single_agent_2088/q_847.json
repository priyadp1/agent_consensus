  "question": "In general, do you think your country's parents put too much pressure on their children to do well in school, not enough pressure, or about the right amount of pressure?",
  "options": [
    "Too much",
    "Not enough",
    "About the right amount"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that many parents tend to put too much pressure on their children to excel academically, often driven by high societal expectations and competition. This can sometimes lead to stress and burnout among students, which suggests that the pressure might be excessive rather than appropriate. While some level of encouragement is beneficial, an overemphasis on academic success can be detrimental to children's well-being. Therefore, I think parents generally put too much pressure on their children to do well in school.\n\nANSWER: A"
