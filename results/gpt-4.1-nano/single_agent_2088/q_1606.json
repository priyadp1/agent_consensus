  "raw_output": "The American economy's current state influences global conditions through trade, investment, and financial markets. When the U.S. economy performs well, it often leads to increased demand for imports and higher investment flows, benefiting many countries. Conversely, economic downturns or instability in the U.S. can cause global disruptions, decrease demand, and create economic uncertainty worldwide. Given the mixed signs and evolving circumstances, the overall impact can be viewed as somewhat balanced or uncertain, but current trends suggest a generally positive effect due to ongoing growth and recovery efforts. Thus, I believe the influence leans toward being positive at the moment.\n\nANSWER: A",
