Historically, the church has played a significant role in shaping moral and social values, but excessive involvement can undermine the principles of secular governance and dilute the effectiveness of political decision-making. Currently, some might feel the church's role is too influential, potentially pushing agendas that do not reflect the diverse views of the population. Conversely, others might argue that the church's voice is too muted in political affairs, missing opportunities to contribute positive moral guidance. Striking an appropriate balance ensures that religious perspectives inform but do not dominate political processes. Therefore, I think the current role of the church is about right.\nANSWER: C",
