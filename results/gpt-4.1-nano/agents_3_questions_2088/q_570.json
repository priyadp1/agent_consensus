When people vote, they have the opportunity to select representatives and policies that reflect their preferences, potentially leading to changes in governance. However, the actual impact of a single vote can be limited, especially in large elections where individual influence is minimal. Still, collective voting has historically been a fundamental mechanism for democratic change, making it relatively effective compared to other forms of influence such as protests or petitions, which may not always translate into immediate policy shifts. Considering this, voting remains a vital and fairly effective tool for influencing government decisions.\n\nANSWER: A",
