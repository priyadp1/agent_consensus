  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe Germany has about the right amount of influence in decision-making within the European Union. Given its size, economic strength, and historical role, it naturally plays a significant part, but the EU's structure aims to ensure a balance among member states. Too little influence would overlook Germany\u2019s importance, whereas too much could threaten the diversity of perspectives within the union. Therefore, the balanced view seems appropriate.\n\nANSWER: C",
