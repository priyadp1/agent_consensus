        "raw_output": "If China were to use military force against Taiwan, the decision for the United States to use military force in defense of Taiwan involves complex considerations, including the defense of regional stability, support for democratic values, and international obligations. Many argue that actively defending Taiwan could prevent aggression and promote regional security, but others highlight the risks of escalating conflict and the importance of diplomatic solutions. Ultimately, whether the U.S. should use force depends on the broader geopolitical context, the nature of the threat, and the potential consequences. Given these factors, I believe that stronger diplomatic efforts should be prioritized over military intervention to avoid further escalation and seek peaceful resolutions.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The decision for the United States to use military force to defend Taiwan in the event of China's aggression involves complex considerations, including strategic interests, commitments to regional stability, and the potential risks of escalation. Supporting intervention could deter further aggression by China and uphold the principle of supporting democracies. However, it also risks significant conflict, regional instability, and unintended consequences. Given these factors, while the defense of Taiwan is important, I believe that the United States should prioritize diplomatic and economic measures initially, reserving military action as a last resort to prevent escalation and maintain regional stability.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The decision for the United States to use military force to defend Taiwan in the event of China's military action depends on various factors, including international security, commitments, and moral considerations. Many argue that supporting Taiwan aligns with promoting democracy and stability in the region, and could serve as a deterrent against aggressive actions. Others believe that getting involved militarily could escalate tensions and lead to broader conflict, risking regional and global stability. Given the importance of upholding commitments to allies and preventing unilateral use of force that threatens regional peace, I believe it is crucial for the US to stand by Taiwan and be prepared to defend it if necessary.\n\nANSWER: A",

Taiwan is a key partner in the region and supports values of democracy and self-determination. Supporting Taiwan not only upholds these principles but also serves as a deterrent to further aggression by China, which could threaten regional and global stability. While the decision involves careful consideration of risks, the importance of commitment to allies and maintaining balance in the Indo-Pacific makes military support necessary in such a scenario. Diplomacy and economic measures are vital, but they should complement a readiness to act decisively if necessary to defend Taiwan.\n\nANSWER: A",
