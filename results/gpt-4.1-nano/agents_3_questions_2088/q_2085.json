        "raw_output": "In my view, the formal education system varies widely across countries and regions. While some institutions do a good job at equipping students with practical skills relevant to the labor market, others may focus more on theoretical knowledge that doesn't always translate directly into employment opportunities. Many graduates find themselves underprepared for the realities of the job market, indicating a gap between education and practical workforce needs. Therefore, I believe that in many cases, the current system does not fully provide people with the necessary skills and training to find employment.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it provides a foundation, there are gaps in providing vocational training, soft skills, and real-world experience that are critical for finding employment quickly and effectively. Therefore, many individuals may still face challenges securing jobs directly through their formal education.
