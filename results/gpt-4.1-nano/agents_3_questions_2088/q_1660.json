        "raw_output": "Based on recent reports and news, there have been some successes in reducing Boko Haram's influence and territorial control, but also setbacks and ongoing threats. The situation remains complex, with some areas experiencing improved stability while others face persistent violence. Therefore, it seems that progress has been made, but it is not comprehensive or definitive enough to say they are winning the fight outright. Overall, I believe the government is making progress, but not fully overcoming Boko Haram yet.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Based on recent reports and ongoing attacks in northeastern Nigeria, it seems that Boko Haram remains active and has shown resilience despite counterinsurgent efforts. While there have been some successes against the group, overall, they continue to carry out attacks and recruit members, indicating that the Nigerian government has not made consistent or significant progress in reducing their influence. Therefore, things appear to be largely the same as in the past, with some fluctuations but no clear overall improvement.\n\nANSWER: C",

However, Boko Haram remnants and threats still persist in certain regions, indicating that while there has been some improvement, the situation remains tense and not fully resolved. Therefore, I believe the campaign has made some progress but is not entirely successful yet.\n\nANSWER: A",

Some evidence suggests that Nigeria has achieved some tangible improvements through better intelligence and military actions, yet Boko Haram still remains active in certain regions, posing persistent threats. The overall picture indicates partial progress but not enough to declare a decisive victory, and the group continues to demonstrate resilience. Therefore, the situation appears to be somewhat improved but still challenging, leading me to conclude that the campaign has made some progress but is not yet fully successful.\n\nANSWER: A",

This indicates a situation where progress has been achieved, but significant setbacks remain. Therefore, I believe the most accurate choice reflects that situation.\n\nANSWER: A",
