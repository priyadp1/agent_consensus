  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Strong sanctions can serve as a deterrent and signal the international community's disapproval of provocations, potentially preventing escalation and encouraging North Korea to reconsider its actions. However, sanctions should be balanced with diplomatic efforts to avoid unintended humanitarian consequences and to promote dialogue. Given the importance of deterring provocations while maintaining open channels for negotiation, I believe strong sanctions are necessary in response to North Korea's provocative behavior.\n\nANSWER: A",
