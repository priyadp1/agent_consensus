        "raw_output": "I believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's handling of the economy has been somewhat mixed. On one hand, his policies aimed at boosting growth through Abenomics have shown some positive results such as increased stock market performance and corporate investment.

Given this, I lean toward disapproval as many citizens and analysts remain cautious or dissatisfied with the overall economic progress, but acknowledge some achievements.\n\nANSWER: B",
