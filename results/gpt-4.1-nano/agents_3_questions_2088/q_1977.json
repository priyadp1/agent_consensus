        "raw_output": "In my view, China's international policy decisions seem to be primarily driven by its own strategic and economic interests, with some acknowledgment of the interests of other countries but not enough to consider them a major factor. While China may consider the interests of other nations, it often prioritizes its own development goals and geopolitical ambitions, which suggests that other countries' interests are not taken into substantial account. Therefore, I believe China takes into account the interests of countries like mine to a fair amount at best, but not significantly enough to be considered a great deal.\n\nANSWER: B",

While China's international policies often promote its own strategic and economic objectives, there are instances where it engages in dialogue and cooperation with other nations, indicating some level of consideration. However, it may not prioritize these interests as highly as its own national priorities, which suggests that it takes them into account but perhaps not to a great extent. Therefore, my perception is that China factors in other countries' interests to a fair amount rather than a great deal or not at all.\n\nANSWER: B",

While China is known for prioritizing its own strategic and economic goals, it also engages in diplomatic efforts and negotiations that consider the concerns of other nations. This suggests that there is some degree of consideration, but it may not be overwhelming or entirely comprehensive. Therefore, my perception is that it is a fair amount rather than a great deal or negligible. \n\nANSWER: B",

While China definitely advances its own strategic and economic goals and may prioritize its national interests, it also engages in diplomatic interactions, negotiations, and cooperation that suggest it does take into account the concerns of other nations. However, based on the responses and general perceptions, this consideration seems to be at a moderate level rather than a high or negligible one.
