        "raw_output": "Strong sanctions can serve as a deterrent and pressure North Korea to cease aggressive actions, promoting regional stability and security. However, the impact of sanctions should be carefully balanced to avoid unintended humanitarian consequences and to ensure they effectively target the provocations without harming innocent civilians. Dialogue and diplomatic efforts should complement sanctions to achieve long-term peace. Given the importance of discouraging provocations while maintaining human rights considerations, I believe that in response to provocations, strong sanctions are justified and necessary.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "In my view, while addressing provocations from North Korea is important to maintain regional stability and deter further threats, implementing extremely strong sanctions should be carefully balanced to avoid unintended consequences such as humanitarian suffering or escalation of tensions. Sanctions can be effective, but they should be part of a broader diplomatic approach that aims for peaceful resolution and denuclearization. Therefore, I believe a measured response is more appropriate than outright strong sanctions in all cases, unless the provocations are particularly severe. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Strong sanctions can serve as an effective way to pressure North Korea into ceasing provocations, sending a clear message that such behavior is unacceptable and will have consequences. They can also help to isolate the regime economically, potentially reducing its ability to sustain provocative actions. However, it is also important to consider the potential humanitarian impact of sanctions and the possibility that they might deepen tensions. Overall, if provocations occur, strong sanctions are a necessary step to maintain regional stability and deter further aggressive behavior.\n\nANSWER: A",

Overly harsh sanctions without consideration of humanitarian impacts may cause suffering and escalate tensions, potentially undermining long-term stability.
