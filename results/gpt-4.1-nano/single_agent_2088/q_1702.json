  "question": "Do you think Japan is a rising economic power, a declining economic power or is Japan's economic power staying about the same relative to other countries?",
  "options": [
    "Rising economic power",
    "Declining economic power",
    "Staying about the same"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Japan's position in the global economy has experienced fluctuations over recent years. While it remains a major player with advanced technology and infrastructure, its relative growth compared to emerging economies like China and India has slowed, and demographic challenges such as aging populations are impacting its economic dynamism. These factors suggest that Japan's economic power is not significantly rising but also not outright declining sharply. Therefore, it appears to be relatively stable, although weighing heavily on the side of stagnation rather than growth. \n\nANSWER: C",
