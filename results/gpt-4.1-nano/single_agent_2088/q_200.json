  "question": "Do you approve or disapprove of the way...U.S. President Barack Obama...is dealing with the new Arizona immigration law?",
  "options": [
    "Approve",
    "Neither approve nor disapprove  (DO NOT READ)",
    "Disapprove"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe President Obama\u2019s response to the Arizona immigration law should be evaluated based on its impact on civil rights, federal authority, and public safety. If I think his approach effectively balances these concerns and fosters fair treatment, I would approve. If I believe he has not addressed the issues adequately or has been inconsistent, I would disapprove. If I am undecided or believe his actions do not significantly impact the situation for me to form a clear opinion, I might choose neither approve nor disapprove. \n\nGiven the complexities and the importance of a balanced response, I might lean toward neutral if I think both sides have valid points without fully endorsing or opposing his handling. \n\nANSWER: B"
