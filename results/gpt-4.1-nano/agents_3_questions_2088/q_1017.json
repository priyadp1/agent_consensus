        "raw_output": "Many people believe that having connections or knowing the right people can significantly influence job opportunities, often giving certain candidates an advantage over others. This can create barriers for those without connections, making it harder for them to find employment even if they are qualified. Although factors like education and experience are important, the role of connections can sometimes be a decisive factor in securing a job. Therefore, I think it is a very important reason.\n\nANSWER: A",
