        "raw_output": "Australia\u2019s relationship with both the United States and China is vital but serves different strategic and economic purposes. The US has historically been a key security partner, offering military alliances and intelligence cooperation that bolster Australia's defense. China, on the other hand, is Australia's largest trading partner, providing significant economic benefits through trade and investment. Balancing these ties is complex, yet for Australia\u2019s long-term economic stability and growth, China\u2019s role appears more crucial currently, despite security concerns. Therefore, I believe China's importance to Australia outweighs that of the United States at this moment, given the scale of economic dependency.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Australia maintains a complex and vital relationship with both the United States and China, but considering economic, strategic, and diplomatic influences, China currently plays a more significant role in Australia's economic stability due to its position as Australia's largest trading partner and primary market for exports. While the United States offers strategic alliances and security partnerships, China's economic influence has a broader impact on Australia's overall prosperity and geopolitical considerations. Therefore, understanding the current economic landscape suggests that China is more important to Australia at this point.\n\nANSWER: B",

The US remains a key military ally and promotes liberal democratic values, while China is Australia's largest trading partner, essential for economic prosperity. Given the current global context, economic ties with China impact Australia's growth considerably, whereas strategic and security alliances with the US are crucial for national security. Therefore, considering the balance between economic dependence and security alliances, China might be slightly more crucial to Australia at this moment, but both countries are vital in different ways. \n\nANSWER: B",

Considering the importance of security and long-term strategic interests, I lean towards the United States being more influential overall. However, given the significant economic dependence on China, both countries are critically important. Still, for a balanced national interest outlook, I think the security partnership with the US has a marginally greater long-term strategic significance.  \nANSWER: A",
