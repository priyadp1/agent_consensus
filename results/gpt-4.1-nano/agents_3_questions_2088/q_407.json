While I recognize the importance of standing up against corruption and might consider reaching out to officials or participating in demonstrations, I probably do so only if I see the issue as urgent or compelling enough. My involvement would depend on my personal capacity, the level of perceived impact, and whether I see collective action making a difference. This makes me somewhat likely to take action rather than very likely, but still indicates a possibility of involvement.\n\nANSWER: B",
