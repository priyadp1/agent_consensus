        "raw_output": "I believe the influence of international investors, banks, and financial organizations on our country's economic policies has increased somewhat more over the past five years. This is due to globalization and the growing role of international financial markets, which often exert greater influence on domestic economic decisions through investment, lending, and economic diplomacy. Although the increase is noticeable, it may not be at a level of a lot more, as some governments still retain significant autonomy over policy decisions. Therefore, \"somewhat more\" seems to best reflect the current trend.\n\nANSWER: B",
