  "question": "(Please tell me how well each of the following describes foreign companies in the mining industry in our country.)...They provide jobs for local workers",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Foreign companies in the mining industry often bring employment opportunities to local communities, especially in regions where mining is a major economic activity. However, the extent to which they provide jobs for local workers can vary depending on company policies, local regulations, and the availability of qualified local labor. Some foreign companies actively hire locally and contribute significantly to employment, which aligns with a \"Very well\" or \"Somewhat well\" perception. Others may rely more on expatriate staff or outsource jobs, leading to a less positive view. Overall, since many foreign mining companies do create jobs for local workers but the quality and quantity can differ, I would say they provide jobs for local workers somewhat well.\n\nANSWER: B",
