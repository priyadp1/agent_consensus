    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "The term \"nationalistic\" can have different connotations depending on context, but generally, it is often associated with pride or loyalty toward one's nation or ethnicity. In the context of China, there is a significant presence of nationalist sentiments and movements, especially in political and social realms. However, not all Chinese individuals or the overall population may hold or be associated with nationalism uniformly. Considering this, I am inclined to associate \"nationalistic\" with the Chinese, given the prominence of nationalist themes in Chinese political discourse and history, but acknowledging that it's not universally perceived by all.\n\nANSWER: A"
