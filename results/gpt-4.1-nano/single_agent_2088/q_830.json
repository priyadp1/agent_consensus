  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Over the past two decades, the role of religion in many countries has generally declined in influence due to increased secularization, globalization, and shifting social values. While some communities and regions may have experienced a strengthening or increased visibility of religious institutions, the overall trend suggests a gradual decrease in religion's societal importance. Therefore, I believe religion has a less important role now compared to 20 years ago.\n\nANSWER: B"
