While there are significant areas of cooperation, such as economic partnerships, trade, and cultural exchanges, there are also ongoing tensions related to historical issues, territorial disputes, and regional security concerns. These factors contribute to a relationship that cannot be characterized solely as cooperative or hostile but rather as one that includes elements of both, often fluctuating over time.
