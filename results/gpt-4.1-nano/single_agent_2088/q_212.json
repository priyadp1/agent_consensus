    "Tries to influence the internal affairs of other countries",
    "Mostly stays out of the internal affairs of other countries",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "The United States has a long history of engaging in international affairs through diplomacy, military interventions, and economic influence. While it publicly promotes values like democracy and stability, it also intervenes in other countries' internal matters at times to protect its strategic interests or promote certain policies. However, there are periods or perspectives where the U.S. may be seen as less involved or staying out of internal affairs altogether. Given the complex nature of U.S. foreign policy, many people might perceive it as consistently trying to influence other countries' internal affairs. Therefore, I believe the most accurate choice reflects this active involvement.\n\nANSWER: A"
