  "question": "From what you have read or heard, how much of an effort is the United States making in attempting to stop the violence in Darfur? Would you say the United States is making a major effort, a minor effort, or no effort at all?",
  "options": [
    "Major effort",
    "Minor effort",
    "No effort"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Based on what I have read and heard, the United States has taken some steps to address the crisis in Darfur, including diplomatic efforts, humanitarian aid, and supporting peacekeeping missions. However, these actions seem limited in scope and intensity, suggesting that while there is some effort, it is not at a level that would be considered major. Therefore, I would classify the effort as minor rather than substantial or nonexistent.\n\nANSWER: B"
