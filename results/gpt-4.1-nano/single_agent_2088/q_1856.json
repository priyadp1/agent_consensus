  "question": "In your opinion, are average people benefiting or not benefiting from Nigeria's oil wealth?",
  "options": [
    "Are benefiting",
    "Are not benefiting"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Many people in Nigeria feel that the wealth generated from oil largely benefits a small elite and multinational corporations, rather than the average citizens. Despite Nigeria being a major oil producer, widespread poverty, unemployment, and infrastructure deficits persist, indicating that the common people do not significantly benefit from the country's natural resources. This disconnect suggests that the average person has not gained proportionally from oil revenues, and the economic benefits are not reaching the general population effectively.\n\nANSWER: B",
