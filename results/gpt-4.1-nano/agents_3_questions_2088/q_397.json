        "raw_output": "I believe that in situations where jobs are scarce, fairness and equality should guide decisions rather than gender-based preferences. Prioritizing one gender over another can lead to discrimination and undermine social equity. From a modern perspective that values equal rights for all, it is important that job opportunities are allocated based on merit and need rather than gender. Therefore, I do not agree that men should have more rights to a job than women in such circumstances. This aligns with the stance that all individuals should be treated equally regardless of gender, especially in employment contexts. \n\nANSWER: D",
