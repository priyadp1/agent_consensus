While I might occasionally give in due to temptation or social influence, overall I make a conscious effort to avoid harmful choices, indicating a moderate to strong tendency. Based on the options, I feel that \"Very Much\" might overstate my refusal pattern, but it captures my general inclination better than the more moderate options.

However, I acknowledge that I do not always succeed in doing so completely, especially in situations involving temptation or social pressure. This suggests a moderate tendency, leaning somewhat towards refusal but not consistently strict. Based on this reasoning, option B (2) seems to best represent my behavior.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there are times I might give in due to temptation or social influences, overall I make a conscious effort to avoid harmful choices. This suggests that I frequently but not absolutely refuse harmful things, leaning towards a strong tendency but not the maximum. Therefore, I feel that \"Very Much\" might slightly overstate my refusal pattern, but it captures my general inclination better than the more moderate options. Based on this reasoning, I would choose the highest option to reflect my overall attitude.\n\nANSWER: D",

However, I recognize that I sometimes give in to temptations or social pressures, which indicates I am not completely strict in my refusals.
