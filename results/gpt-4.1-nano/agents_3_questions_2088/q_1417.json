        "raw_output": "I tend to trust European standards more when it comes to food safety because the European Union has stringent regulations, thorough testing procedures, and transparent monitoring systems. European agencies often set high benchmarks to protect consumers, and their precautionary approaches tend to be more conservative, which can result in safer food products. American standards are also rigorous, but in some cases, they prioritize industry so-called innovation and economic factors, which might sometimes lead to different safety thresholds. Therefore, based on the perceived strictness and consumer protection focus, I have greater confidence in European standards.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I tend to trust European standards more when it comes to food safety because the European Union has a comprehensive and strict regulatory framework for food safety, including rigorous testing and transparent labeling. These standards are often seen as more protective for consumers and emphasize precaution. Additionally, Europe's emphasis on environmental sustainability and consumer health influences its standards' perceived reliability. On the other hand, American standards are also stringent but may sometimes prioritize economic factors or innovation, which can lead to differences in safety approaches. Overall, my choice is based on the perception that European standards are more meticulous and consumer-focused.\n\nANSWER: A",

The European Union's precautionary approach and transparent quality assurance measures contribute to a perception of higher reliability in their standards. While American standards are also comprehensive, some people perceive European regulations as more stringent or environmentally conscious, which influences trust levels.
