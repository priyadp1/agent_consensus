  "options": [
    "Freedom to pursue life's goals without interference",
    "State/government guarantees nobody in need"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that ensuring individuals have the freedom to pursue their goals without interference from the state is fundamental for personal autonomy and innovation. When people are free to chart their own paths, society tends to thrive through diversity and creativity. While social safety nets are important, they should not come at the expense of personal liberty, as excessive state intervention can limit individual choice and initiative. Therefore, fostering a society where freedom is prioritized helps create an environment conducive to growth and fulfillment for all.\n\nANSWER: A"
