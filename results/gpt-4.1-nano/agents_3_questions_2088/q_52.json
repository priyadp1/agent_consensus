        "raw_output": "My opinion may depend on recent developments, but generally I believe the European Union has faced significant challenges in managing economic issues effectively, balancing member countries' interests, and implementing policies that stimulate growth and stability. While some initiatives have shown promise, there are ongoing concerns about the EU's ability to address economic disparities and respond swiftly to crises.

        "raw_output": "My opinion on the European Union's handling of European economic issues depends on its recent policies and their impacts on the economy. If the EU has successfully maintained economic stability, promoted growth, and managed financial crises effectively, I would approve. Conversely, if its policies have led to economic hardship, instability, or ineffective responses, I would disapprove. Without specific context, I recognize that opinions may vary. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that the European Union's approach to European economic issues garners mixed opinions. Some people feel that the EU effectively manages economic policies, promotes growth, and stabilizes markets, leading to approval. Others might think that the EU's measures are not enough, overly bureaucratic, or not in the best interest of their country, leading to disapproval. Without specific context or personal perspective, I lean towards disapproval because economic policies can often be viewed unfavorably by those who feel their countries have been negatively impacted or feel the EU is still working on effective solutions. Therefore, I choose disapprove.\n\nANSWER: B",
