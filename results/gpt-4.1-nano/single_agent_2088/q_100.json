  "options": [
    "People should be able to say these things publically",
    "Government should be able to prevent people from saying these things",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that freedom of speech is a fundamental right, and individuals should have the ability to express their opinions publicly, even if those opinions are offensive to minority groups. Limiting such speech could suppress important discussions and set a precedent for censorship. However, there should be careful limits to prevent real harm, such as hate crimes or incitement to violence, but outright suppression of offensive statements may threaten free expression overall. Therefore, I think people should be able to say these things publicly.\n\nANSWER: A"
