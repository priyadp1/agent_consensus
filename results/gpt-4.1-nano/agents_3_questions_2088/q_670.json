        "raw_output": "My perception of the territorial disputes between my country and China depends on the specific context and recent developments. If these disputes threaten national sovereignty, security, or economic stability significantly, I might consider them a very big problem. If they are ongoing but manageable without major implications, they could be viewed as a big or small problem. However, if the disputes are largely resolved or do not affect daily life or national interests noticeably, I might see them as not a problem at all. Generally, unless the disputes have proven to be highly disruptive or contentious recently, I would lean toward considering them a manageable issue rather than a major crisis.\n\nANSWER: C",

Such disputes often attract considerable attention from policymakers and the public, reflecting their importance in national security and stability. Therefore, I believe they are likely viewed as a big problem in many countries that have ongoing territorial disagreements with China.\n\nANSWER: B",

In some areas, the disputes are a significant source of tension and could impact stability or economic relations, making them a very big problem. In other cases, they might be managed diplomatically or be of limited immediate concern, so they are seen as a smaller problem or not a problem at all. Overall, given the potential for escalation and broader implications, I tend to believe these disputes are at least a big problem but not necessarily the very biggest concern for my country. \n\nANSWER: B",
