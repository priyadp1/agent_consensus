  "question": "Do you think the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, has been a very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad or very bad thing for your country?",
  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe NAFTA has been somewhat good for my country because it has increased trade and economic opportunities with the United States and Mexico, leading to job creation and growth in certain industries. However, it has also caused some challenges, such as job losses in sectors that couldn't compete with imports, and concerns about labor and environmental standards. Overall, the impact has been mixed, making it more appropriate to consider it as somewhat good rather than very good or very bad. \n\nANSWER: B"
