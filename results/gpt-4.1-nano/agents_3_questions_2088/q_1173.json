        "raw_output": "Posting thoughts or comments on political or social issues online can have some influence, especially as it raises awareness and encourages discussions among users. However, the overall impact on actual government decisions or policies is limited because policymakers often prioritize formal channels like voting, lobbying, or direct advocacy. While online activism can mobilize support and draw attention to issues, it does not always translate directly into policy change. Therefore, I believe it is somewhat effective, but not the most powerful method for influencing government actions.\n\nANSWER: B",

It can also influence others\u2019 opinions and sometimes attract media attention, which may lead to broader discussions and policy considerations. However, it generally has limited influence on actual government decisions since political processes are often more affected by organized advocacy, voting, and direct lobbying. Therefore, while online expression contributes to a collective voice, its direct impact on government actions tends to be moderate. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Posting thoughts or comments online can be a powerful way to raise awareness, mobilize supporters, and hold governments accountable. Many social and political movements have gained momentum through online platforms, helping to shape public discourse and influence policy changes. However, the actual impact of individual online comments varies\u2014often limited by factors like the reach of the post, the platform used, and whether policymakers or the public pay attention. While online activism is an important tool, it may not always translate directly into concrete government action without additional avenues of influence such as organized advocacy, voting, or in-person protests. Overall, I believe it's somewhat effective as part of a broader strategy but not the most decisive method on its own.\n\nANSWER: B",
