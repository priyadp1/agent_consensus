  "raw_output": "Hosni Mubarak was the longtime President of Egypt and a prominent figure in the Middle East. His leadership was often viewed as authoritarian, with accusations of corruption and human rights abuses. While some may have seen him as a stabilizing force during his time in power, the widespread protests and eventual ousting in the 2011 Egyptian revolution reflect largely negative views of his tenure. Therefore, my opinion aligns more with unfavorable sentiments, considering the significant criticism of his regime's actions and legacy.\n\nANSWER: D",
