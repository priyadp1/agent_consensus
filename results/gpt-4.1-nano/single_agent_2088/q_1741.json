  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe collaboration between local and federal authorities can improve security and coordination, especially in tackling organized crime. Centralizing police control might lead to more consistent standards and resources, which could help create a more effective law enforcement system across the country. However, I also recognize potential concerns about local autonomy and the importance of local knowledge in policing. Overall, I support the plan as a way to strengthen national security efforts, provided proper measures are taken to ensure oversight and respect for local needs.\n\nANSWER: A",
