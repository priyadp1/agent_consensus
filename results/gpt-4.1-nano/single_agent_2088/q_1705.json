  "question": "In your opinion, do you think the European Union is being too tough, not tough enough, or about right in dealing with Russia on the issue of Ukraine?",
  "options": [
    "Too tough",
    "Not tough enough",
    "About right"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe the European Union's response should be calibrated to avoid escalation while supporting Ukraine effectively. Being too tough might risk provoking further conflict or harming diplomatic relations, whereas not tough enough could embolden Russia and undermine stability in the region. Striking the right balance is crucial, and based on current developments, the EU appears to be handling the situation appropriately by imposing sanctions and offering support without crossing into overly aggressive measures. Therefore, I think their approach is about right.\n\nANSWER: C",
