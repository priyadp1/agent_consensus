  "options": [

  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe promoting democracy globally can help foster stability, human rights, and economic development, which benefits both other nations and the US in the long run. However, it's important that such efforts are respectful of national sovereignty and avoid interventionist policies that could cause unintended harm or resentment. Striking a balance between supporting democratic values and respecting the autonomy of other countries seems most prudent. Therefore, I lean toward the US promoting democracy around the world, but with careful and respectful approaches.\n\nANSWER: A"
