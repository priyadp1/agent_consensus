  "raw_output": "My assessment of President Vladimir Putin's handling of civil society is mixed. On one hand, his government has implemented laws and policies that restrict the activities of NGOs and independent organizations, which constrains the development of a vibrant civil society. On the other hand, he has also supported certain patriotic and government-aligned groups, which some may interpret as bolstering civil society within a controlled framework. Overall, these actions suggest a disapproval of how he manages civil society, as they limit pluralism and independence. \n\nANSWER: B"
