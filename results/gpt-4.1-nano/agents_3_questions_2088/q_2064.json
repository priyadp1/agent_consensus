        "raw_output": "The effectiveness of the formal education system varies significantly across different countries and regions. In many cases, education provides a strong foundation of knowledge, but it may not always align with the rapidly changing demands of the job market. Skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, digital literacy, and practical training are sometimes underemphasized, leading to a gap between what is taught and what is needed in the workplace. Therefore, while some systems do a good job, many fall short in adequately preparing people for their jobs.\n\nANSWER: B",
