  "question": "Some countries are considering a ban on Muslim women wearing full veils that cover all of the face except the eyes in public places including schools, hospitals, and government offices. Would you approve or disapprove of such a ban in your country?",
  "options": [
    "Approve",
    "Disapprove"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to express their religious and cultural identities, including wearing religious attire such as the full veil. However, in certain public spaces like schools, hospitals, and government offices, safety, security, and societal norms should take precedence to ensure everyone\u2019s protection and comfort. Therefore, I disapprove of blanket bans that restrict religious attire in these settings, as they can infringe on personal freedoms and religious rights. Instead, nuanced policies respecting individual rights while maintaining public safety are preferable.\n\nANSWER: B"
