        "raw_output": "Over the past ten years, the level of pressure associated with voting can vary significantly depending on the country and political environment. In some regions, increased polarization, misinformation campaigns, or authoritarian tendencies might have reduced voters' freedom to choose freely without feeling pressured. Conversely, in places with strengthened democratic institutions and more open political discourse, this freedom might have increased. Overall, considering global trends, many democratic societies have experienced both challenges and improvements in this area, but there has been a noticeable rise in political pressure in various parts of the world. Therefore, I believe there has been a decrease in the freedom to choose who to vote for without feeling pressured in many contexts.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Over the past decade, while there have been efforts to promote democratic participation and protect voting rights, many people still experience pressures\u2014be it from social, political, or peer influences\u2014that can influence their sense of free choice. In some regions, increased political polarization and targeted misinformation campaigns might have heightened feelings of intimidation or pressure, reducing genuine freedom to choose without external influence. Conversely, in other areas, improvements in transparency and civic education could have enhanced individual freedom. Considering these mixed factors, it seems that overall, the sense of having an unpressured choice may have decreased slightly over ten years.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Over the past decade, the level of pressure during voting has varied significantly across different regions and political climates. In some areas, increased polarization, misinformation, and social pressures have made voters feel more scrutinized and pressured about their choices. Conversely, other regions have seen efforts to strengthen electoral transparency and protect voter rights, thereby enhancing personal freedom to vote without coercion. Overall, it seems that the general trend has been towards more contentious environments in many places, which could diminish the sense of free choice. Based on this, I believe there is now less freedom to choose who to vote for without feeling pressured compared to ten years ago.\n\nANSWER: B",
