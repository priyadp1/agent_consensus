    "World War II",
    "U.S.-Japan military alliance since World War II",
    "U.S.-Japan \u201ctrade wars\u201d of the 1980s and early 1990s",
    "2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan",
    "None of the above (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the most important event is World War II because it fundamentally reshaped the relationship between the United States and Japan. This conflict led to Japan's surrender, occupation, and subsequent transformation into a democratic ally. The post-war order established during this time set the foundation for decades of cooperation, security agreements, and economic partnership. Without this pivotal event, the subsequent alliances and interactions might not have developed as they did. While other events like the security alliance or economic disputes are significant, the aftermath of World War II was the catalyst for the enduring relationship between the two nations.\n\nANSWER: A",
