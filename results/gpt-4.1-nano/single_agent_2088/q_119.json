  "question": "I'd like your opinion about the effectiveness of different ways of trying to influence what the government does. How effective is it to...participate in labor strikes...very effective, somewhat effective, not too effective, or not at all effective?",
  "options": [
    "Very effective",
    "Somewhat effective",
    "Not too effective",
    "Not at all effective"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Participating in labor strikes can be quite influential because they directly impact economic productivity and draw public and governmental attention to workers' concerns. Strikes have historically been effective in prompting negotiations or policy changes, especially when they involve large groups or essential industries. They demonstrate collective power and can disrupt business as usual, putting pressure on the government to respond. Therefore, I believe they are generally quite effective in influencing government actions.\n\nANSWER: A"
