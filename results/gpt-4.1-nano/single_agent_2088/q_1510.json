  "question": "I'd like your opinion about the effectiveness of different ways of trying to influence what the government does. How effective is it to...post links to political stories or articles for others to read ONLINE...very effective, somewhat effective, not too effective, or not at all effective?",
  "options": [
    "Very effective",
    "Somewhat effective",
    "Not too effective",
    "Not at all effective"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Sharing links to political stories or articles online can raise awareness and inform others, but its direct influence on government action often depends on whether these shared pieces lead to wider discussions, mobilization, or activism. While it has some potential to inspire change, its overall power is limited if not accompanied by other efforts like voting, protesting, or lobbying. Therefore, I believe it falls into a middle ground of influence, being somewhat effective but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nANSWER: B",
