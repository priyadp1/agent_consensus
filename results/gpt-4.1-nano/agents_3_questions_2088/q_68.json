This can lead to higher costs for consumers, insufficient support for small businesses, and increased inequality. Their actions sometimes contribute to economic instability, which impacts many citizens negatively.

        "raw_output": "In many countries, banks and major financial institutions play a crucial role in supporting economic growth through loans, investments, and financial services. When these institutions operate transparently and ethically, their influence can be seen as positive, fostering development and stability. However, concerns about unfair practices, excessive profits, or contributing to economic inequality can lead to negative perceptions. Overall, depending on the country's financial regulation and banking practices, their influence may be viewed as somewhat good or somewhat bad. But given widespread concerns about financial sector misconduct and economic inequality, the influence is often viewed negatively by many people.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "Many people feel that banks and major financial institutions have had a mostly negative impact on the country\u2019s economic situation. They cite issues such as economic inequality, financial crises, and a focus on profit over public good. While some argue that these institutions provide essential services and stability, the overall perception tends to lean toward viewing their influence as problematic rather than beneficial. Therefore, I believe their influence is perceived as somewhat bad or very bad.\n\nANSWER: D",
