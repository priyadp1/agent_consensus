        "raw_output": "In my opinion, the primary motive for the U.S. using military force against Iraq is more about addressing the perceived threat Saddam Hussein poses to regional stability and global peace. The concerns about weapons of mass destruction, support for terrorism, and authoritarian rule led the U.S. to justify military intervention largely as a measure to prevent further instability. While access to oil resources may have been a consideration, the dominant publicly stated reason for the invasion was the need to eliminate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and promote security in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "In my view, the primary reason behind the U.S. potentially using military force against Iraq is its concern over Saddam Hussein's perceived threat to stability in the Middle East and global peace. The US has historically emphasized regional security, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the destabilizing potential of Saddam's regime. While controlling Iraqi oil may be a strategic interest, it seems more likely that the official rationale focuses on security threats and maintaining international order. Thus, the threat posed by Saddam Hussein aligns more closely with the publicly asserted reasons for military intervention. \n\nANSWER: A",

Historically, concerns about Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction and its regime's aggressiveness contributed significantly to U.S. justification for military intervention. While some argued that control of Iraqi oil was an underlying interest, the publicly stated rationale emphasized security and stability issues. Therefore, the main driver seems to be the threat to stability rather than economic interests alone.\n\nANSWER: A",
