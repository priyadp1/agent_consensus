  "question": "All in all, do you think the January elections in Iraq will lead to a MORE stable situation, a LESS stable situation, or will the situation in Iraq not change much?",
  "options": [
    "More stable",
    "Less stable",
    "Situation will not change much"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The upcoming elections in Iraq could potentially lead to increased stability by enabling political processes and possibly addressing some of the underlying conflicts, but they also risk exacerbating tensions or being influenced by external actors, which might undermine stability. Given these uncertainties, it is difficult to predict a clear, significant improvement or deterioration in stability. Therefore, the most reasonable expectation is that the situation may remain relatively unchanged in the short term.\n\nANSWER: C"
