In some places, these conflicts are quite pronounced, possibly involving disputes over moral issues, societal values, or perceptions about religious influence. In others, such conflicts are relatively minor or barely noticeable. Generally, I believe these conflicts are present but are typically not very strong, as many societies promote coexistence and mutual understanding across different belief systems.\n\nANSWER: C",

Generally, in many societies, these conflicts are not very strong or might only be perceived as moderate, since in many modern countries, religion is often a personal affair and open disagreement is less common. Therefore, I would lean towards the view that such conflicts are not very strong. \n\nANSWER: C",

While there may be some disagreements or tensions, they often coexist peacefully in many societies. However, depending on cultural contexts, there can occasionally be more pronounced conflicts, but overall, they tend to be moderate rather than intense.

The majority of answers suggest that these conflicts tend to be moderate at most, often due to societal context and cultural differences, and are usually not intense or openly hostile.
