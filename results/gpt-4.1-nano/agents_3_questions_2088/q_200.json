        "raw_output": "I believe that the handling of the Arizona immigration law by President Obama was a complex issue that involved balancing legal principles, states' rights, and immigration reform efforts. Given the controversies and debates surrounding the law, I might lean towards disapproval, considering that some viewed the law as potentially infringing on certain civil liberties, while others felt it was necessary for security. However, acknowledging that there were nuances and various perspectives, a neutral stance of neither approving nor disapproving could also be justified. Ultimately, since I am asked to choose one, I will opt for a cautious approach indicating some reservations.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I would disapprove of the way President Obama is dealing with the Arizona immigration law because the law was controversial and many believed it encouraged racial profiling and led to increased tensions. The federal government's approach to addressing such laws should ideally involve careful consideration of civil rights protections and collaborative legal strategies rather than passive acceptance or strict opposition alone. Therefore, I lean toward disapproval given the complexity and sensitivity of the issue.\n\nANSWER: C",
