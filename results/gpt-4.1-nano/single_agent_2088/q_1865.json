  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that being born in a country can be an important factor in establishing one's nationality, as it often determines legal citizenship and cultural identity. However, in today's interconnected world, many argue that nationality can also be defined by other factors, such as naturalization, personal identity, and allegiance, making birthplace less solely decisive. Therefore, I consider it somewhat important in defining one's nationality but not the sole criterion.\n\nANSWER: B",
