        "raw_output": "My perception of the United States' power and influence greatly depends on current international dynamics. If the influence is perceived as aggressive or destabilizing, I might see it as a threat. Conversely, if it promotes stability and cooperation, I would view it as less threatening or not a threat at all. Considering the global role of the United States and its tendency to influence international affairs, many would see its power as a potential concern if it leads to conflicts or dominance. Therefore, I consider it a minor threat, as the influence can be both beneficial and problematic depending on context, but it often raises concerns about geopolitical stability.  \nANSWER: B",
