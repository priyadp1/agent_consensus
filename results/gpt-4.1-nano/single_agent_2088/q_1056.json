  "question": "Right now, the U.S. has the most powerful military capability in the world. In the future, should U.S. policies try to keep it so America is the only military superpower or would it be better if Europe, China or another country became as powerful as the U.S.?",
  "options": [
    "U.S. only superpower",
    "Better if another country became as powerful as U.S."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Maintaining U.S. dominance in military power can provide stability and ensure national security, but concentrating power solely in one country could also increase risks of escalation and global instability. Promoting a balanced distribution of military capabilities among multiple nations could foster international cooperation, reduce the likelihood of conflicts, and promote peace through mutual deterrence. Therefore, it might be better if other countries, such as those in Europe or China, became as powerful as the U.S., leading to a more multipolar world where power is more evenly spread and stability is maintained through cooperation.\n\nANSWER: B",
