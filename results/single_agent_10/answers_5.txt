Question 5
Please tell me if you approve or disapprove of the way Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is handling each of the following areas. b. the refugee issue

I would approve of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's handling of the refugee issue. His approach emphasizes border control and national sovereignty, which aligns with the interests of many Hungarians who prioritize safeguarding their country’s security and cultural identity. While some criticize this stance for lacking compassion or humanitarian considerations, from a pragmatic perspective, it reflects a focus on maintaining social stability and respecting Hungary's legal and political frameworks.
