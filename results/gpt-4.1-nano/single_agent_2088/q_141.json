  "question": "Right now, is the Chinese economy having a positive or negative impact on economic conditions in the rest of the world?",
  "options": [
    "Positive",
    "Negative",
    "Neither/both (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The Chinese economy currently influences global economic conditions through multiple channels. On the positive side, China's continued growth supports demand for exports, boosts commodity prices, and fosters opportunities for international trade and investment. However, recent economic challenges and slowdowns in China have also contributed to uncertainties, reduced global growth prospects, and disruption in supply chains. Consequently, the overall impact is nuanced, with both positive and negative elements present. Given this complexity, it can be reasonable to see the impact as neither entirely positive nor negative, but rather a mixture of both.\n\nANSWER: C"
