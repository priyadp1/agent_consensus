    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",

  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that economic prosperity largely reflects the overall health and success of our country\u2019s economy, including job opportunities, income levels, and growth. While many may perceive that our country is experiencing economic improvements, there are still significant challenges such as income inequality, inflation, and unemployment that prevent a consensus that prosperity describes the country very well. Therefore, I would say it describes our country somewhat well, acknowledging progress but also recognizing ongoing issues.\n\nANSWER: B",
