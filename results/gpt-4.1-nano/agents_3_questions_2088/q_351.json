        "raw_output": "I believe that the violence in Syria poses a significant risk of spreading to neighboring countries, especially considering the regional history of conflicts crossing borders and the instability that often accompanies civil unrest. This potential impact concerns me quite a bit, as it could lead to broader regional instability, refugee crises, and increased violence. Therefore, I would choose the option that reflects a high level of concern.\n\nANSWER: A",

The historical precedent of regional conflicts crossing borders, coupled with ongoing refugee movements and regional tensions, increases the likelihood of instability escalating beyond Syria\u2019s borders.
