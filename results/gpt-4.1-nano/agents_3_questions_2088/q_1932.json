        "raw_output": "The operation to kill Osama bin Laden was carried out by the United States Navy SEALs in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011. The Pakistani government officially stated that it was not informed about the specific operation beforehand, which suggests a lack of direct authorization. Some speculate that the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies might have had some knowledge or tacit approval, but there is no concrete public evidence confirming they officially authorized the raid. Given the information available, the most reasonable conclusion is that the Pakistani government did not officially authorize the operation.\n\nANSWER: B",

While some reports suggest the military and intelligence agencies may have had prior knowledge or tacit approval, there is no definitive proof that the government officially authorized the raid. This ambiguity is often discussed in the context of complex political and security considerations within Pakistan. Given the lack of clear confirmation, I do not believe the government officially authorized the operation.\n\nANSWER: B",
