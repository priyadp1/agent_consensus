        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Germany, as the largest and most economically powerful member of the European Union, naturally holds significant influence over EU decision-making. While some people may feel that Germany's level of influence is justified given its contributions and role in the EU, others might perceive it as excessive, potentially overshadowing smaller member states and disproportionately shaping policies in its favor. The debate centers around whether this influence promotes effective governance or if it risks undermining the principles of equality among member states. Personally, I believe that Germany's influence appears to be somewhat excessive, though it is understandable given its economic stature.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Germany is often perceived as a leading and influential member within the European Union due to its economic strength, political stability, and central role in shaping EU policies. Many people believe that Germany wields considerable influence in decision-making processes, sometimes to a degree that others might consider excessive, especially given its size and economic power. Conversely, some argue that its influence is appropriate or insufficient, depending on the perspective on European integration and sovereignty. Overall, I think Germany's influence tends to be perceived as somewhat overbearing by some and justified by others, but generally, it is seen as a dominant power in the EU decision-making landscape.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Germany is widely recognized as one of the most influential member states within the European Union, given its economic strength and central geopolitical position. While some may argue that this influence is justified due to its contributions and leadership, others might feel that it dominates decision-making to the detriment of smaller or less influential members. On balance, I believe Germany\u2019s influence aligns appropriately with its role, responsibilities, and contributions in the EU, reflecting a balance that avoids undue dominance but recognizes its importance. Therefore, I think Germany has about the right amount of influence.\n\nANSWER: C",

Given its economic strength, size, and central role within the union, Germany naturally exerts significant sway over policies and agenda-setting. While some influence is necessary for stability and effective governance, the extent of Germany's power can overshadow smaller member states, potentially leading to an imbalance that favors German interests.
