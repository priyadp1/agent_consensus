        "raw_output": "The Western sanctions on Russia have likely had a noticeable impact on the global economy, influencing energy prices, trade flows, and economic stability. These effects can have indirect consequences on individual economies, such as increased costs or market uncertainties. However, the extent of the impact on a specific country's economy varies depending on their own economic ties and reliance on Russian trade and energy. Many experts suggest the effect is significant but not necessarily catastrophic, indicating a major or at least a considerable influence, but perhaps not an overwhelming one. Given this, I believe the sanctions have had at least a major effect on the economy.\n\nANSWER: A",
