        "raw_output": "I believe that maintaining or improving Egypt's relationship with the United States could be beneficial for regional stability, economic cooperation, and diplomatic support. A closer relationship might facilitate better collaboration on security issues and development projects, which are important for Egypt's national interests. However, some may prefer to keep the relationship steady or less close to assert greater independence.

        "raw_output": "My preference leans toward maintaining a balanced relationship with the United States, neither increasing nor decreasing the level of closeness significantly. Closer ties could bring economic and security benefits, but might also impact Egypt's autonomy or regional relationships. Conversely, less close relations might foster independence but could reduce beneficial cooperation. Therefore, I think keeping the relationship about the same as in recent years is the most prudent approach to ensure stability and continued collaboration.\n\nANSWER: B",

Being closer could lead to stronger diplomatic and economic ties, but it might also affect Egypt's independence in decision-making and its regional relationships. Staying about as close as in recent years allows Egypt to continue engaging with the U.S. strategically while preserving flexibility in its foreign policy. Being less close might reduce influence but could isolate Egypt diplomatically. Therefore, I lean toward keeping the relationship at its current level to balance international partnerships and national interests.\n\nANSWER: B",
