        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "I believe that the generally poor relations between Muslims and Western countries are the result of complex historical, political, and media-driven factors that involve both sides. Western countries have often engaged in policies that marginalize or stigmatize Muslim communities, while misunderstandings and negative stereotypes perpetuated in media and political discourse contribute to the divide. At the same time, actions or reactions from some individuals within Muslim communities can sometimes be misinterpreted or contribute to tensions. Given the shared responsibility and the multifaceted nature of the issue, I think blaming only one side oversimplifies the situation. Therefore, I choose both as the primary contributors to the strained relations.\n\nANSWER: D",

Often, misunderstandings, media portrayals, political decisions, and lack of intercultural dialogue contribute to tensions. Both communities have responsibilities in building mutual understanding and respect. Therefore, blaming only one group oversimplifies a complex issue. It is more productive to recognize that multiple factors and parties play roles in shaping these relations.\n\nANSWER: D",

While some tensions may stem from misunderstandings, cultural differences, or political issues, it is often an oversimplification to attribute blame solely to one group. Both sides may contribute to misperceptions and conflicts, and focusing on mutual understanding and dialogue may be more constructive than assigning blame to a single group.\n\nANSWER: D",
