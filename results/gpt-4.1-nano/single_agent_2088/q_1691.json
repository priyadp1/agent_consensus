  "raw_output": "I believe that President Nicolas Maduro's handling of relations with Cuba is a complex issue. Some might see it as a strategic alliance that helps Venezuela maintain political stability and access necessary economic support. Others may view it as an undue influence that hampers Venezuela's sovereignty and creates dependencies. Given these perspectives, my personal view may lean toward disapproval due to concerns about autonomy and influence, but I also recognize the importance of regional alliances.
