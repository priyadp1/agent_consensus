    "Very serious",

  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Tensions between Mainland China and Hong Kong have historically been a significant concern for the stability and autonomy of Hong Kong, as well as for regional security. Given the ongoing political disputes, protests, and China's increasing influence in the region, these tensions could escalate and impact economic and diplomatic relations. Therefore, I believe they pose a relatively serious problem for the U.S., especially considering its interests in stability and influence in Asia.\n\nANSWER: A"
