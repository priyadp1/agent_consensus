        "raw_output": "I would lean toward supporting the removal of all restrictions on investment between the U.S. and the European Union because this could promote economic growth, create jobs, and foster stronger diplomatic ties. Removing restrictions can make it easier for businesses to operate seamlessly across borders, encouraging innovation and investment. However, there are concerns about safeguarding national security, protecting workers, and ensuring fair practices, which means I am not fully supportive without proper safeguards. Considering this, I somewhat support the idea, trusting that appropriate regulations will be maintained to address these concerns.\n\nANSWER: B",
