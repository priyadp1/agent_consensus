  "question": "When it comes to foreign aid, do you think your country needs more foreign aid than it gets now, less foreign aid or about the same?",
  "options": [
    "More",
    "Less",
    "About the same",
    "None (VOL)",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe my country needs less foreign aid because it currently allocates sufficient resources to address domestic issues and prioritize its own development. Redirecting some aid could allow for more effective use of available funds internally, especially if foreign aid is not being fully utilized or is not reaching targeted areas effectively. Therefore, I think my country should receive less foreign aid than it does now.\n\nANSWER: B"
