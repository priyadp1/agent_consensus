        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "The current economic situation is complex, but I believe that Western sanctions have had the most significant and sustained impact. They restrict access to international markets, limit foreign investment, and hinder economic growth. Falling oil prices also affect the economy, but many nations manage such fluctuations better over time. While government policies can influence economic outcomes, their effectiveness depends on how they adapt to external challenges. Overall, sanctions create the most persistent barriers, making them the primary source of harm in this context.\n\nANSWER: A",

      "1": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "While all three factors impact the economy to some extent, current government economic policies are likely causing the most harm because they shape the overall structural direction of the economy, influence investor confidence, and determine fiscal stability. Poor or inconsistent policies can exacerbate problems caused by external factors like sanctions or oil prices, making reforms and policy adjustments imperative for recovery and growth.\n\nANSWER: C",
        "model_failed": false

      "2": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe that current government economic policies are causing the most harm to our economy because they directly influence fiscal stability, investment climate, and overall economic growth. Poor policies can exacerbate issues caused by external factors like sanctions or oil prices, leading to prolonged economic challenges. While sanctions and falling oil prices have significant impacts, effective policies could mitigate some of these effects or steer the economy toward recovery. Therefore, I see the policies as the primary factor affecting our economic health at this time.\n\nANSWER: C",

Poor or inconsistent policies, on the other hand, tend to exacerbate existing issues and hinder economic progress.

        "raw_output": "I believe that current government economic policies are causing the most harm because they directly shape the economic environment and influence how external challenges like sanctions and oil prices affect the country. Effective policies could potentially cushion some of these external shocks, but poor or inconsistent policies tend to exacerbate economic instability and hinder recovery. While sanctions and falling oil prices are significant external factors, the internal policy response is critical in mitigating or worsening their impact.\n\nANSWER: C",

      "2": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "In my opinion, current government economic policies are causing the most harm because they directly influence the overall economic stability and growth prospects. Effective policies can either mitigate or exacerbate external shocks like sanctions and oil price fluctuations. If policies are poor or inconsistent, they can undermine investor confidence, lead to budget deficits, and hinder economic resilience, making it difficult to recover from external pressures. While sanctions and falling oil prices have significant impacts, responsible and well-designed policies can help cushion or address these external challenges, so the root of ongoing harm stems largely from domestic policy decisions.\n\nANSWER: C",

Effective policies can mitigate adverse effects of sanctions and falling oil prices, while poor policies can worsen the situation by reducing investor confidence, increasing deficits, and hampering growth. Therefore, I think the root cause of ongoing economic harm lies primarily in the decisions made by the current government.\n\nANSWER: C",
