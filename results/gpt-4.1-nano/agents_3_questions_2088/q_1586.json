        "raw_output": "I believe that people should generally have the freedom to express themselves, including in ways that are sexually explicit, as free speech is a fundamental aspect of open society. However, this freedom should have limits when such expressions are harmful, non-consensual, or violate others' rights. In many cases, some regulation is necessary to prevent offense or exploitation, but outright bans can infringe on personal freedoms. Therefore, I lean towards allowing individuals to speak freely while recognizing that in certain circumstances, government oversight may be justified to protect public interest.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Allowing people to express themselves freely, even if it involves sexually explicit statements, upholds free speech principles. However, certain restrictions might be necessary to prevent harm, especially for vulnerable audiences like minors. Therefore, I believe that while free expression should generally be prioritized, some regulation to prevent potential harm or offense could be justified in specific circumstances. Nonetheless, restrictions should be carefully balanced to avoid censorship that infringes on individual rights.  \nANSWER: A",

Restricting such expressions could infringe on individual rights to free speech and personal autonomy. However, in certain contexts such as public spaces or in media accessible to minors, some regulation might be appropriate. Overall, maintaining open free speech supports a free society, but safeguards are necessary to balance this right with responsible communication.\n\nANSWER: A",
