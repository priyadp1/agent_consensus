It aims to promote international cooperation and stability, which often aligns with our national interests. However, some may see it as prioritizing certain countries or agendas over others, which can impact how well it advances our specific interests. Overall, I think it generally supports the interests of countries like ours, but with some reservations.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that the United Nations does not specifically advance the interests of countries like ours, as its focus is on global cooperation and addressing issues that affect many nations rather than prioritizing individual country interests. Many criticisms suggest that smaller or less powerful countries often find their specific interests overlooked or marginalized within the UN's broader agenda. Therefore, I think this statement does not accurately apply to the UN.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it works to promote peace, development, and human rights worldwide, some may perceive that it does not always prioritize the specific interests of any one country, especially those like ours with larger influence. Therefore, whether it advances our interests depends on the context and the issues at hand. Given this nuance, I believe it somewhat aligns with our interests but not exclusively or always. \n\nANSWER: B",
