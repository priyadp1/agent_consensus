Question 1
Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of ____. b. Moderate Party

I would say I have a somewhat favorable opinion of the Moderate Party. 

My reasoning is that the Moderate Party, being a center-right political party in Sweden, often advocates for economic liberalization, improved public services, and pragmatic policies. While I may not agree with all their positions or approach, their focus on responsible governance and moderation appeals to me. The fact that their overall positive ratings in Sweden are relatively higher than their negatives suggests they are generally viewed favorably, which informs my balanced view.
