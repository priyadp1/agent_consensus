        "raw_output": "International financial instability can significantly impact a country's economy, especially if the country relies heavily on exports, foreign investment, or international trade. Such instability can lead to currency fluctuations, increased borrowing costs, and economic downturns. While some countries may be better insulated, the interconnectedness of global markets means that financial turmoil can quickly spill over and affect many nations, including ours. Therefore, I consider it a major threat to our economic stability and well-being.\n\nANSWER: A",

While our economy may be somewhat resilient, persistent instability abroad can lead to economic downturns domestically, increased costs, or reduced growth opportunities. Therefore, I believe it poses at least a minor threat to our country. However, it might not always rise to the level of a major threat unless compounded by other issues or occurring during a particularly vulnerable period. Still, it's a concern worth paying attention to.\n\nANSWER: B",
