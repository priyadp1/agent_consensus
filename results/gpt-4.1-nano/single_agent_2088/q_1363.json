  "question": "And overall, do you approve or disapprove of this new policy that expands the number of undocumented immigrants who are allowed to stay and work in the United States? (Asked of those who have heard a lot/little about this proposal)",
  "options": [
    "Approve",
    "Disapprove",
    "Don't know/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "My opinion on this policy depends on considerations of its impact on the economy, community integration, and legal processes. If I believe that expanding protections for undocumented immigrants benefits society overall by promoting workforce stability and humanitarian values, I might approve. Conversely, if I think it undermines immigration laws or creates unfair advantages, I may disapprove. Given the complex nature, I might not have a strong definitive stance without more detailed information, leading me to choose \"Don't know/Refused.\" Nonetheless, for the purpose of the survey, I feel somewhat cautiously optimistic, assuming it aligns with positive social values.\n\nANSWER: A",
