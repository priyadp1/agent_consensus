  "options": [
    "Understands Europe better than most other US presidents",

  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "George W. Bush's understanding of Europe has been a subject of debate. While he did engage with European leaders and took certain policy positions that aligned with American interests, critics argue that his approach sometimes lacked depth in European historical and cultural context. Compared to other American presidents who had more extensive diplomatic experience or stronger European ties, Bush's grasp may have been somewhat limited. Therefore, he is generally viewed as understanding less about Europe than most other US presidents.\n\nANSWER: B"
