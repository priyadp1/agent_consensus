        "raw_output": "The likelihood of conflicts with in-laws when a woman works outside the home can vary greatly depending on cultural norms, family dynamics, and societal attitudes toward women working. In some cultures or families with traditional views, a working woman may face increased conflict or disapproval from in-laws who expect women to fulfill domestic roles. Conversely, in more modern or accepting environments, such conflicts might be less common. Given this variability, it is reasonable to consider that there is at least some chance of conflicts occurring, though it is not certain for all situations.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The likelihood of conflicts with in-laws arising from a woman working outside the home can vary greatly depending on cultural, social, and familial contexts. In some traditional families, a woman working might be seen as a challenge to traditional gender roles, potentially leading to disagreements or conflicts with in-laws. Conversely, in more progressive families or communities where women working is common and accepted, such conflicts may be less likely. Given the diversity of societal norms and the fact that conflict is not an automatic consequence, the most balanced choice would be that such conflicts are only somewhat likely, but not inevitable in all cases.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Whether a woman working outside the home leads to conflicts with her in-laws depends heavily on cultural, social, and individual family dynamics. In some societies with traditional views on gender roles, a woman working might be seen as a challenge to familial or cultural expectations, increasing the likelihood of conflicts with in-laws. Conversely, in more progressive or accepting families, this is less likely to be an issue. Therefore, given these variations, I believe it is somewhat likely that this could happen in certain contexts, but not universally. \n\nANSWER: B",

In traditional settings, such conflicts might be more common due to differing expectations and gender roles, while in more accepting environments, they are less likely.

In such contexts, her employment may challenge familial norms and provoke disapproval or disagreements.

In settings where traditional gender roles are deeply ingrained, it is more probable that tensions or conflicts could arise, especially if the woman's employment challenges existing family dynamics. Conversely, in more modern or liberal environments, such conflicts are less likely or may be less severe.
