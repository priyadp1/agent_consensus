  "question": "Do you think the world would be a safer place or more dangerous place if there was another country that was equal in power to the United States?",
  "options": [
    "Safer place",
    "More dangerous",
    "More dangerous place"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe the world would be more dangerous if there was another country with power equal to the United States. When two superpowers exist, it can lead to increased tensions, competition, and potential conflicts, as each nation may feel compelled to assert dominance or defend its interests aggressively. The possibility of a power struggle or arms race escalates the risk of instability and violence on a global scale. Therefore, having two equally powerful countries might heighten the chances of conflict rather than prevent danger. \n\nANSWER: C"
