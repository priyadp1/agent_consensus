        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I would choose C (Not too much confidence) because Hugo Chavez was known for his strong nationalist stance and often challenged U.S. policies, which sometimes strained international relations. While he had certain principles and strategic alliances, his approach to global affairs was unpredictable and sometimes controversial, leading to a lack of full confidence in his ability to consistently prioritize global stability and cooperation.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I would probably select not too much confidence. Hugo Chavez was known for his strong nationalist stance and alignment with socialist policies, often challenging U.S. influence and advocating for regional sovereignty. While he played a significant role in Latin American politics, his approach to international affairs was sometimes controversial and unpredictable, which might lead to a cautious or less trusting view of his ability to consistently do the right thing on the global stage.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Hugo Chavez was known for his strong anti-imperialist stance and his desire to bring a new kind of leadership to Latin America. While he was vocal and assertive on the international stage, many critics questioned the consistency and pragmatism of his foreign policy decisions. His approach often reflected personal ideology rather than measured diplomacy, which could lead to unpredictability in world affairs. As a result, I find my confidence in his ability to do the right thing regarding global matters to be limited, given the potential for unilateral or ideologically driven actions that may not always align with broader international interests.\n\nANSWER: C",

His approach was often characterized by assertiveness that could lead to unilateral actions rather than consensus-building, which may not always serve broader international interests effectively.
