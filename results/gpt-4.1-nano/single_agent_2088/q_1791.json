  "question": "Do you think that the Philippine government is making progress in its campaign against illegal drugs, losing ground or are things about the same as they have been in the past?",

    "Making progress",
    "Losing ground",

  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe the progress of the Philippine government\u2019s campaign against illegal drugs has been limited, with some efforts showing results but overall issues still persisting. There have been initiatives and some improvements, but the scale and complexity of drug-related problems suggest that the situation remains challenging and that the government might be losing ground in certain areas, especially considering ongoing concerns and reports of continued drug activities. Therefore, I think things are roughly the same as they have been in the past, with no clear and decisive progress evident. \n\nANSWER: C",
