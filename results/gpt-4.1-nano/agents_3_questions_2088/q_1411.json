        "raw_output": "Increased trade with China can bring both opportunities and challenges for Germany. On the positive side, it can boost economic growth, create jobs, and promote innovation through access to Chinese markets and goods. However, there are concerns about trade imbalances, dependency on a single partner, intellectual property issues, and potential geopolitical tensions. Balancing these factors, I believe that increased trade with China would be somewhat good for our country, as the benefits may outweigh the drawbacks if managed carefully, but it also poses certain risks that need to be addressed.\n\nANSWER: B",
