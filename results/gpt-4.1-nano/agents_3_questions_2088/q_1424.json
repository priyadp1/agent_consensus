        "raw_output": "The UK's departure from the European Union could be perceived as a negative development for the EU, potentially undermining its unity, influence, and economic stability due to the loss of a significant member. Such a move might weaken the collective bargaining power of the remaining member states and create economic and political uncertainties that could ripple through the EU. On the other hand, some might argue that it allows the EU to focus on reform and better address its core priorities without the complexities introduced by the UK's departure. Overall, given the interconnectedness and shared interests, many would see the UK's exit as a challenge or a setback for the EU's cohesion and strength.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The UK's departure from the EU can have mixed implications for the European Union. On one hand, it might be seen as a setback or a loss of a significant member, which could weaken the EU\u2019s influence and financial stability. On the other hand, it might also serve as a catalyst for reform within the EU or reassure other member states that they have the option to leave if unhappy, potentially strengthening its resilience in the long run. Overall, these complex consequences make it difficult to classify the impact as purely positive or negative, hence the designation of \"Both\" to capture the nuanced effects.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The UK leaving the European Union could be perceived as a negative development for the EU because it indicates a member country\u2019s departure, potentially weakening the union\u2019s political and economic cohesion. Such a rupture might also set a precedent that encourages other member states to consider leaving, thereby undermining the EU\u2019s stability and influence globally. However, some might argue that the departure allows the EU to focus on its core priorities without the UK\u2019s influence, potentially strengthening the union internally. Overall, given the potential for destabilization and diminished unity, it is more likely to be viewed as a bad thing for the European Union.\n\nANSWER: B",
