  "options": [
    "Advocating legal imposition of strict shari'ah on\u00a0all Muslim",
    "Using violence to get rid of non-Muslim influences in countr"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that Islamic extremism, to me, primarily involves advocating for the implementation of strict Shari'ah law on all Muslims, which often implies imposing religious laws through legal means. While violence can be associated with extremism, it is more often a tactic or symptom rather than the core meaning. Therefore, I lean toward the idea of a legal imposition of religious rules rather than necessarily using violence as the main characteristic. \n\nANSWER: A"
