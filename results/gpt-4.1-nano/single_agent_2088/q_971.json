  "raw_output": "Terrorism remains a significant concern for many countries because it threatens national security, safety, and stability. Depending on recent events and regional context, it can be perceived as either a very big problem or less pressing. Given the general global awareness and ongoing threats, it is reasonable to consider it a moderately to very big problem. However, since the question asks for a general subjective opinion, I believe it is best to recognize it as a very big problem due to its potential impact.\n\nANSWER: A",
