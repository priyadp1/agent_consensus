  "question": "In general, to what extent do you think the United States takes into account the interests of other countries around the world in making international policy decisions...a great deal, a fair amount, not too much, or not at all?",
  "options": [
    "Great deal",
    "Fair amount",
    "Not too much",
    "Not at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the United States considers the interests of other countries to a fair amount. While national interests and security often take precedence, there are numerous instances where diplomacy, international agreements, and aid programs reflect an awareness and responsiveness to other nations' concerns. However, it still may not always prioritize these interests as highly as its own, leading me to select a moderate level of consideration rather than a great deal or none at all.\n\nANSWER: B",
