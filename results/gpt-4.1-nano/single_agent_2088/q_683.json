  "question": "And in your opinion, should the government in Kiev recognize the results of the March 16th referendum and allow Crimea to join Russia? ",
  "options": [
    "Yes, government should recognize the results",
    "No, government should not recognize the results"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The question of Crimea's status is complex and highly sensitive, involving international law, sovereignty, and regional stability. Recognizing the results of the referendum and allowing Crimea to join Russia could be seen as respecting the will of the local population; however, many international actors, including the United Nations, do not recognize the legitimacy of the referendum conducted under disputed circumstances. Recognizing such a move without a broad international consensus may undermine the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty. Therefore, it is important for the government in Kiev to uphold international agreements and seek diplomatic solutions rather than endorsing referenda that are widely considered to lack legitimacy.\n\nANSWER: B"
