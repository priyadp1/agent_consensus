Question 4
In your opinion, how strong a sense of Islamic identity do Muslims in our country have--very strong, fairly strong, not too strong, or not strong at all?

In my opinion, Muslims in our country tend to have a fairly strong sense of Islamic identity. Many Muslims adhere to their religious traditions, cultural practices, and values, which often serve as a key aspect of their personal and community identity. While the strength of this identity can vary among individuals, overall, it seems that Islamic identity remains an important and noticeable part of many Muslims' lives here.
