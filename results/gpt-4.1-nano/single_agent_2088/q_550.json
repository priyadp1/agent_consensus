    "Yes, likely",
    "No, not likely"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "If Iran develops nuclear weapons, there is concern that they might provide them to terrorist organizations due to regional rivalries and Iran's history of supporting non-state actors. This potential for proliferation increases the risk of weapons falling into malicious hands, which could destabilize the region and threaten global security. Therefore, it is more likely that Iran could provide nuclear weapons to terrorist groups than not. \n\nANSWER: A"
