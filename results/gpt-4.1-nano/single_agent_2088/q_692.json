  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Many people believe that foreign companies in the mining industry tend to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, perhaps seeking to maximize profits by shifting costs elsewhere. This perception is often based on reports of tax disputes or lack of transparency. However, some may feel that this view is too general and that not all foreign companies behave this way. Considering these factors, I believe that the statement describes the situation somewhat accurately.\n\nANSWER: B"
