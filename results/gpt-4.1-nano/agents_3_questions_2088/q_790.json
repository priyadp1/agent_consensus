However, considering the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats and occasional reports of vulnerabilities, I think there is still room for improvement and uncertainty about the country's full readiness. Hence, I lean towards \"somewhat well\" rather than feeling extremely confident or completely unprepared.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there may be some efforts and protocols in place, many vulnerabilities remain, especially given the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats and the challenges in coordinating various agencies and private sector partners.
