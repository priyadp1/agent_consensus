However, it also raises concerns due to geopolitical conflicts, human rights issues, and sanctions that might complicate the relationship and impact national security. Given these considerations, I believe that increased trade with Russia would be somewhat bad for our country overall because the potential risks and complications outweigh the benefits.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Increased trade with Russia could have mixed implications. On one hand, expanding trade might foster better economic relations and mutual benefits, which could be positive for some sectors. On the other hand, given geopolitical tensions and concerns over human rights and foreign policy issues, many might view increased trade as potentially problematic or risky for national interests. Considering these factors, I believe that increased trade with Russia might pose more challenges than benefits for the country, especially in the current geopolitical climate.\n\nANSWER: C",

On one hand, it might foster better relations and economic opportunities, which could be beneficial. On the other hand, given geopolitical tensions, sanctions, and differing values, increased trade could also exacerbate conflicts or compromise U.S. interests. Considering these factors, I believe that increased trade might not be entirely advantageous and could pose challenges, making it more harmful than beneficial. Therefore, it seems more appropriate to view it as somewhat bad for our country.\n\nANSWER: C",
