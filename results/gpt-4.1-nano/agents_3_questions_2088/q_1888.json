        "raw_output": "Politicians have likely benefited from the significant political, economic, and social changes since 1989/1991, especially in post-communist countries where shifts in power, economic reforms, and increased influence of media and lobbying have created opportunities for political gain. While some may argue that these changes have led to substantial advantages for politicians, others might view the benefits as moderate or limited, depending on the country's specific context and the transparency of political processes. Overall, considering the broad scope of changes and their impact on political careers and influence, it seems that politicians have gained a fair amount of benefit from these transformations.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The extent to which politicians have benefited from the changes since 1989/1991 depends on various factors, including their ability to adapt to new political landscapes, access to resources, and personal ambitions. Given the significant political, economic, and social shifts during that period, some politicians might have gained substantial advantages, especially those who capitalized on new opportunities created by reforms. However, others may have experienced limited benefits or even setbacks due to the upheaval and uncertainty. Overall, considering the complexities and the uneven distribution of benefits, my judgment leans towards them having benefited to a fair amount, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Politicians have generally benefited quite significantly from changes since 1989/1991, as many have consolidated power, gained increased influence, and retained their positions through various political and economic transformations. These changes often favored established political figures and elites, providing them with opportunities for career advancement and economic benefits, sometimes at the expense of broader democratization or reform. While not every politician or situation has benefited equally, on a broader scale, the benefits appear substantial. Therefore, I believe they have benefited a great deal. \n\nANSWER: A",
