  "raw_output": "My perspective on territorial claims and national borders is that they are complex and rooted in historical, political, and cultural contexts. I believe that borders are generally established through international agreements and recognized sovereignty, and claims of land belonging to neighboring countries are often contentious and subject to legal and diplomatic resolution. Therefore, I lean toward disagreeing with the statement that parts of neighboring countries really belong to us, as it suggests a territorial claim that may not be legitimate or widely accepted.\n\nANSWER: D",
