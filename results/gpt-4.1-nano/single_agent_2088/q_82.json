  "options": [
    "Mostly help",
    "Mostly hurt",
    "No effect (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "European companies building factories in our country can have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, they can create jobs, introduce new technology, and boost local industries, which generally helps the economy. On the other hand, if these companies repatriate profits offshore or displace local businesses, the benefits may be limited or even cause harm. Overall, the economic impact largely depends on how these investments are managed and integrated into the local economy. Generally, such foreign direct investment tends to be more beneficial than harmful in the long run when properly regulated and supported.\n\nANSWER: A"
