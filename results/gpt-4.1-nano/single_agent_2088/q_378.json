  "raw_output": "Felipe Calder\u00f3n, as a former president of Mexico, has a mixed reputation depending on one's political perspective and recent developments. Some may view his policies on security and economic reform favorably, while others criticize his handling of the war on drugs and its associated violence. Given the divided opinions and considering no overwhelming positive or negative consensus universally, I lean toward a moderate assessment. Therefore, I might categorize my opinion as somewhat favorable, acknowledging some appreciation but also reservations about his tenure.\n\nANSWER: B"
