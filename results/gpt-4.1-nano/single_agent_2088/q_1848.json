  "question": "For each of the following statements about the drone attacks, please tell me whether you agree or disagree...they kill too many innocent people.",
  "options": [
    "Agree",
    "Disagree"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that drone attacks raise significant concern because they often result in the loss of innocent lives, which is morally troubling and can undermine public trust in using such military methods. Ensuring the safety of non-combatants should be a priority, and if there is credible evidence that these attacks are causing excessive civilian casualties, then I would agree that they kill too many innocent people. Therefore, I lean toward agreeing with the statement to advocate for more precise and cautious military actions to protect innocent lives.\n\nANSWER: A",
