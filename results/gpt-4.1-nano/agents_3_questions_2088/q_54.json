        "raw_output": "George W. Bush's foreign policy decisions, especially during his presidency, were primarily driven by U.S. strategic interests, security concerns, and economic considerations. While he engaged with European leaders and collaborated on certain issues such as NATO operations and counter-terrorism, the overall approach emphasized American interests first and foremost. His administration's focus on the Iraq War and the War on Terror reflected a prioritization of U.S. national security over European interests, which sometimes led to tensions within the Transatlantic alliance. Therefore, the option that best describes his decision-making approach is that he makes decisions based entirely on U.S. interests.\n\nANSWER: A",
