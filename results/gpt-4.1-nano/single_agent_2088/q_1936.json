  "question": "Over the next several years, do you think Cuba will become more democratic, less democratic or will it be about the same as it is now?",
  "options": [
    "More democratic",
    "Less democratic",
    "About the same",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Given Cuba's current political landscape and historical trends, it is unlikely that the country will become significantly more democratic in the coming years. While there may be some reform efforts or limited political changes, the entrenched control of the government suggests stability rather than a move toward greater democracy. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Cuba will remain about the same in terms of its democratic status.\n\nANSWER: C",
