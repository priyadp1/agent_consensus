If such conflicts lead to violence, social division, or undermine national stability, it can be considered a very big problem. In many countries, religious conflicts have historically caused severe disruptions and suffering, which makes addressing or preventing such conflicts very important. However, in places where religious groups coexist peacefully and conflicts are rare or easily managed, it might be less problematic, perhaps only a small or moderate issue.
