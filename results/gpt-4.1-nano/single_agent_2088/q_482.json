  "raw_output": "I believe that military actions in conflict zones are complex and should be carefully weighed against their potential consequences.

However, if it leads to increased violence or suffering among civilians, disapproval could be warranted. Without detailed information on the objectives and outcomes, I lean toward disapproval to prioritize peaceful and diplomatic solutions. \n\nANSWER: B"
