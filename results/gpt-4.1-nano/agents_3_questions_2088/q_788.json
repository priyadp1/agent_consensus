Depending on current policies or leadership, individual opinions may vary.

        "raw_output": "I would select B because I have a generally positive view of the CDU, appreciating its policies and leadership, but I also recognize that there are some aspects I find less favorable or that I am somewhat cautious about.

While I appreciate its influence, I have some reservations about its current policies or leadership, which prevent me from feeling very favorable. At the same time, I do not feel strongly enough to view it as unfavorable. Therefore, my opinion falls in the middle range.\n\nANSWER: B",

My view is generally positive because I appreciate its role in shaping policies and its influence in German politics. However, I may have some reservations or critiques about certain policies or leadership, which makes my opinion cautious rather than enthusiastic.
