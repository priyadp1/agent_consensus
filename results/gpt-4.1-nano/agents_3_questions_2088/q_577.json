        "raw_output": "Ensuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stays in power is a highly controversial issue, with many believing that his rule has contributed to ongoing violence and instability in Syria. Supporting this goal might be seen as prioritizing stability or political interests, but it also ignores the broader humanitarian concerns and calls for change. Given the complex and divisive nature of this issue, many would consider it important but not the highest priority compared to other aspects of the conflict, or they might oppose intervention altogether. Therefore, I believe it should be seen as important but lower priority, balancing strategic interests with ethical considerations.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Ensuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stays in power is a complex issue with significant international implications. Supporting his continuation could provide stability from the perspective of those who see him as a key actor in the region, but it also raises concerns about human rights abuses and ongoing conflict. Given these considerations, I believe it should be prioritized cautiously, recognizing the importance of stability yet also the need for addressing broader political and humanitarian concerns.

Supporting Assad's staying in power could stabilize certain interests in the region, but it may also legitimize authoritarian rule and hinder efforts towards peace and democracy. Given the importance of prioritizing human rights and potential long-term regional stability, I believe it should be considered important but lower priority, as other efforts like political reconciliation and humanitarian aid might be more pressing.\n\nANSWER: B",
