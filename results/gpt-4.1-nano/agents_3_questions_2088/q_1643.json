        "raw_output": "Over the past decade, Russia's global influence has experienced significant shifts. While it has maintained strategic importance, recent years have seen increased tensions with Western countries, especially following conflicts and sanctions. Its role in regional conflicts, cybersecurity, and energy markets has grown, impacting global geopolitics. However, it hasn't necessarily become more influential overall compared to 10 years ago, given the mixed assessments of its power and influence. Therefore, it seems that Russia's importance on the world stage remains roughly consistent with a decade ago, despite some fluctuations.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Russia's role in the world has evolved significantly over the past decade. Ten years ago, Russia was primarily seen as a regional power with limited global influence, but in recent years, its actions\u2014such as interventions in Ukraine, Syria, and efforts to project military strength\u2014have increased its prominence on the global stage. These developments suggest that Russia now exerts a more influential role in international affairs than it did a decade ago. Therefore, I believe it plays a more important role today compared to 10 years ago.\n\nANSWER: A",
