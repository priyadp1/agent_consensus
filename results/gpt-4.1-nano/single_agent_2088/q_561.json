    "Is a good example for other countries to follow",
    "Used to be a good example, but has not been in recent years",
    "Has never been a good example for other countries to follow",

  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that democracy in the United States has faced significant challenges and criticisms, especially in recent years, which have impacted its reputation as a model for other countries. While it still embodies foundational democratic principles, the extent of political polarization, concerns over election integrity, and social issues suggest it may not serve as the ideal example it once was. Therefore, I see it as having been a good example historically but not in recent years.\n\nANSWER: B"
