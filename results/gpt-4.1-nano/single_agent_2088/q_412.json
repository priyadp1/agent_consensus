    "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)",
    "Indian National Congress (INC) party",
    "Other (VOL)",
    "None (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the Indian National Congress (INC) might have a better approach to controlling rising prices because they have historically implemented policies aimed at regulating prices and providing subsidies to make essential goods more affordable. While the BJP has also taken measures, the Congress's focus on social welfare programs suggests they could be more effective in addressing inflation and supporting consumers. Therefore, I think the INC could do a better job in this area.\n\nANSWER: B"
