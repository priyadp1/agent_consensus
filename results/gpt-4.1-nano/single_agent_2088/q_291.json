  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The influence of media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion, political discourse, and cultural perceptions in the country. While it provides valuable information and a platform for diverse voices, there are concerns about media bias, sensationalism, and the spread of misinformation which can distort reality and undermine trust. Overall, this impact tends to be mixed, but considering the potential for both positive and negative effects, I believe the influence is more leaning towards being somewhat good rather than very good, but not severely harmful. Therefore, I choose a moderate assessment of media influence.\n\nANSWER: B"
