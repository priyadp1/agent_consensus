        "raw_output": "My reasoning is that Canada's relationship with the United States has historically been characterized by strong economic and security ties, but there is also value in maintaining a certain level of independence to preserve national sovereignty and cultural identity. If Canadians generally value a balanced approach, they might prefer to keep the relationship about as close as it has been, ensuring cooperation without over-reliance. Given the importance of a steady partnership, I would lean toward maintaining the current level of closeness to foster stability and mutual benefit. \n\nANSWER: B",
