  "raw_output": "The fairness of the judicial system is often perceived as a crucial indicator of overall justice and equality in a country. Based on recent reports and public sentiment, there have been concerns about delays, biases, and inconsistencies that suggest the system may be facing challenges. Although some efforts have been made to improve transparency and accountability, these issues indicate that the situation has not markedly improved and might be deteriorating or at least remaining problematic. Therefore, I believe it is more accurate to consider that the fairness of the judicial system is worsening.\n\nANSWER: B",
