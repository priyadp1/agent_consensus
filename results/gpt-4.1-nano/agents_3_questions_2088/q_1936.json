While there might be some opening or reform efforts, systemic changes that lead to increased democracy appear limited given the government's current stance.

The government maintains a firm grip on political power, and recent developments suggest that any moves toward greater democracy may face substantial resistance. While there could be some minor or superficial changes, substantial shifts toward increased democracy seem improbable without profound structural changes.
