  "question": "Do you personally believe that married people having an affair is morally acceptable, morally unacceptable, or is it not a moral issue? ",
  "options": [
    "Morally acceptable",
    "Morally unacceptable",
    "Not a moral issue",
    "Depends on the situation (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the morality of a married person having an affair depends on the context and circumstances involved. While fidelity is an important aspect of committed relationships, certain situations might make the issue more complex, such as if the marriage is already struggling or if there are underlying issues that haven't been addressed. However, generally, infidelity tends to undermine trust and commitments made within a marriage, which I see as morally problematic. Overall, I think it's often viewed as morally unacceptable, but not always universally so, depending on the specific situation.\n\nANSWER: D",
