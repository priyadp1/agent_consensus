        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I have limited confidence in Chinese President Hu Jintao to do the right thing regarding world affairs, as China's policies and international actions during his leadership period have often been viewed with skepticism by Western countries and critics, especially concerning human rights issues, territorial disputes, and global diplomacy.
