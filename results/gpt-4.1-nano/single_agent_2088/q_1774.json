  "question": "In your opinion, if the Taliban were to regain control of Afghanistan would it be a good thing for Pakistan, a bad thing for Pakistan, or would it not matter?",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad",
    "Would not matter"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The resurgence of Taliban control in Afghanistan could have significant implications for Pakistan. Historically, Pakistan has maintained complex relations with the Taliban, sometimes supporting and other times confronting them, largely due to regional security concerns and the impact on interior stability. If the Taliban were to regain full control, it could potentially lead to increased instability in Afghanistan, which might spill over into Pakistan through refugee flows, cross-border militancy, and regional insecurity. However, some might argue it could also stabilize certain aspects of the region if the Taliban establish a government aligned with Pakistan's strategic interests. Overall, the uncertainty and potential for increased instability suggest it would likely be a negative development for Pakistan.\n\nANSWER: B",
