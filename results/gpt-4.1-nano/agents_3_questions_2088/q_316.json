        "raw_output": "A system where a strong leader can make decisions without interference from parliament or courts may effectively lead to quick decision-making and decisive action, especially in situations requiring urgent responses. However, it also poses significant risks to checks and balances, potentially allowing abuse of power, undermining democratic principles, and reducing accountability. While some may see it as efficient, many would view such a system as dangerous for the health of the nation's democracy and individual rights.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "A system where a strong leader can make decisions without interference from parliament or courts might be seen as efficient in certain situations, especially during crises or times requiring quick decision-making. However, it also risks abuse of power, lack of accountability, and the suppression of dissenting voices, which can undermine democratic principles and human rights. While some may view it as a means to restore order or stability, many others would see it as dangerous for the long-term health of the country. Overall, this governance style tends to be problematic because it concentrates power and bypasses important checks and balances that protect citizens and uphold democracy.\n\nANSWER: D",

However, it also raises concerns about the potential for abuse of power, lack of accountability, and suppression of democratic processes.
