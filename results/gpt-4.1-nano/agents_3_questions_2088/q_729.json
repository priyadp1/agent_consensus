        "raw_output": "I believe the PRI could potentially do a better job in dealing with organized crime and drug traffickers because, despite its past controversies, it has historically maintained more resources and institutional structures dedicated to security efforts. Its experience in governance might allow for more coordinated strategies. However, the effectiveness largely depends on current leadership and commitment, so perceptions may vary. The PAN and PRD may have different approaches or criticisms, but in terms of institutional capacity, the PRI seems better suited to handle these issues.\n\nANSWER: A",

      "1": {
        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe the party that could do a better job of dealing with organized crime and drug traffickers is the PRI. Historically, the PRI has had more experience in handling complex security issues within Mexico, and its political influence has allowed it to implement policies aimed at combating organized crime. Although their approach has faced criticism for corruption and human rights concerns, they potentially have the institutional capability and resources to address these serious issues more effectively than the other parties, which often lack the same level of experience or political power in security matters.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "I believe that none of the traditional major parties\u2014PRI, PAN, or PRD\u2014have demonstrated a consistent and effective approach to tackling organized crime and drug trafficking issues. The complexities of these issues require innovative, transparent, and long-term strategies that often go beyond party politics. Given the history of corruption and mismanagement associated with these parties, I think it is more appropriate to consider new or independent approaches rather than trusting established parties with such critical security concerns.\n\nANSWER: D",

Its political influence may allow it to implement more effective strategies against organized crime and drug traffickers, even though its past shortcomings are a concern. The effectiveness of any party ultimately depends on their current policies and integrity, but given the options and historical context, the PRI appears to be the most equipped to address these serious issues directly.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "I believe that traditional political parties like the PRI, PAN, and PRD have historically struggled with effectively addressing organized crime and drug trafficking due to issues of corruption and institutional weaknesses. While the PRI may have some experience and resources, this does not necessarily translate into better outcomes given past failures. The concern about corruption and disillusionment with established parties suggests that new or independent approaches might be better suited to tackling these complex issues. Therefore, I think that none of these parties currently have the proven capacity to effectively manage organized crime and drug traffickers, and trust might be better placed elsewhere.\n\nANSWER: D",

Despite past controversies, the PRI\u2019s extensive history in governance suggests it might have a better foundation to implement effective strategies in this area compared to other parties. Therefore, I choose the PRI as the party that could do a better job in handling these issues.\n\nANSWER: A",

Others argue that institutional weaknesses make any party currently ineffective, favoring new approaches. Given these perspectives, I find the argument that the PRI\u2019s institutional capacity might offer the best chance for improvement to be compelling, especially since experience can be leveraged for better strategies if corruption is addressed.
