I tend to pay attention to major international developments that have a direct or significant impact on my country or global affairs, but I do not devote extensive time to staying updated on every international issue.

        "raw_output": "Both responses indicate a moderate level of engagement with news about other countries, describing it as \"somewhat closely\" or \"moderately interested\" without deep or frequent coverage. Since I also fall into a similar category of engaging with international news in a moderate, somewhat attentive manner, I will align with this description. \n\nI do not follow international news very closely on a daily basis, nor do I ignore it entirely. My interest is consistent with moderately paying attention to major international events and issues that are relevant or impactful. Therefore, I choose the same level of engagement as the others described.\n\nANSWER: B",
