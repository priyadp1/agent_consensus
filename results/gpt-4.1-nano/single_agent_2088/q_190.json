  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The decision on Russia's military involvement in Syria depends on considerations such as regional stability, international relations, and domestic interests. Increasing involvement could potentially strengthen Russia's strategic position but might lead to greater tensions and costs. Maintaining the current level allows Russia to support its goals without escalating conflicts. Decreasing involvement might reduce risks but could also weaken Russia's influence in the region. Given the complexities, maintaining the current level of involvement seems to strike a balance between strategic interests and minimizing escalation.\n\nANSWER: B"
