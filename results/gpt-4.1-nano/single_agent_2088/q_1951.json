    "Very big problem",
    "Moderately big problem",
    "Small problem",
    "Not a problem at all",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that too few citizens participating in politics is a very big problem because it can lead to decreased representativeness and a weaker democracy. When many voters abstain or feel disengaged, political decisions may not reflect the will of the people, which can undermine trust in institutions and reduce accountability. Encouraging greater political participation is essential for a healthy and functioning democracy.\n\nANSWER: A",
