        "raw_output": "I believe that the United States primarily promotes democracy in areas where it aligns with its strategic and economic interests. While there is an ideological aspiration to support democratic values globally, historical and policy analyses suggest that practical considerations often guide where diplomatic and intervention efforts are focused, favoring regions that benefit national objectives. This pragmatic approach tends to overshadow a purely altruistic promotion of democracy, making it more conditional on national interests rather than an unwavering commitment to democratic principles everywhere. \n\nANSWER: B",

While there is genuine support for democratic values, the emphasis on promoting democracy tends to align with national interests, such as stabilizing regions for economic gains or preventing security threats. This pragmatic approach suggests that promotion of democracy is sometimes secondary to serving national interests.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe that the United States promotes democracy both out of genuine commitment and strategic interests. However, it seems that in many cases, promoting democracy aligns with advancing its geopolitical and economic interests, which suggests a tendency to prioritize those interests when engaging in such efforts. While there are instances of sincere promotion, the influence of national interests often guides where and how democracy is promoted, implying that the latter perspective is more accurate for a comprehensive view.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there are genuine efforts and ideals backing democratic promotion, evidence suggests that these efforts are frequently influenced or motivated by national self-interest to maximize influence, stability, or economic gain. This pragmatic approach indicates that serving U.S. interests largely guides its promotion of democracy rather than purely altruistic motives.\n\nANSWER: B",

Historically and in current policy, promoting democracy seems to be more conditional and aligned with national objectives rather than universally driven by altruistic motives.
