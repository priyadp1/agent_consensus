While some traditions are still valued and upheld, their influence and visibility seem to be diminishing overall.

These forces tend to weaken and diminish longstanding customs and cultural practices, making it difficult for traditions to remain as strong and visible as they once were. While some traditions persist, the overall trend appears to be one of erosion rather than resilience. Therefore, I see our traditional way of life as getting lost.\n\nANSWER: A",
