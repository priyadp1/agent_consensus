  "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can have mixed effects on wages depending on various factors such as the types of goods traded, the relative productivity of workers, and the competitiveness of domestic industries. Some studies suggest that increased trade can lead to higher wages by expanding markets and encouraging productivity and innovation. Conversely, other analyses point out that workers in less competitive or declining industries may face wage pressures or job displacement, potentially lowering wages in certain sectors. Overall, the impact is complex and context-dependent, but many argue that, on average, trade tends to create opportunities for wage growth through increased efficiency and economic growth.\n\nANSWER: A",
