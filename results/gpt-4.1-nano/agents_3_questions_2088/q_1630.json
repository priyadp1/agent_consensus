        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Iran's pursuit of a nuclear program could be motivated by multiple factors. While some may believe the primary reason is energy needs due to Iran's reliance on fossil fuels and the desire to diversify its energy sources, others interpret Iran's nuclear ambitions as aimed at developing weapons for strategic deterrence or regional influence. Given the complexity, it is plausible that Iran's efforts are driven by both factors simultaneously, seeking energy independence while also maintaining the capability to develop nuclear weapons as a strategic asset.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Iran likely pursues a nuclear program for both energy and weapons purposes. While developing nuclear energy can help meet domestic power needs and demonstrate technological advancement, there is also a strategic interest in possessing nuclear weapons for regional influence and security concerns. The dual nature of Iran's nuclear ambitions suggests they are motivated by both these factors simultaneously.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Iran likely aims to develop nuclear energy to meet its growing energy needs and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, which is a common motivation for many countries investing in nuclear power. While concerns about potential weapon development exist, the primary publicly stated reason for Iran's nuclear program is energy generation. This helps support economic growth and energy security for the country, making nuclear energy a strategic asset rather than solely a military pursuit.\n\nANSWER: B",

While the country's publicly stated goal is energy development to meet domestic power demands and promote economic growth, there is also significant international concern about the possible development of nuclear weapons for strategic security and regional influence. Given these factors, Iran's nuclear ambitions seem to encompass both reasons simultaneously. Therefore, the most comprehensive choice is to acknowledge both motivations.\n\nANSWER: C",

While Iran publicly states that its goal is to develop nuclear energy to meet domestic power demands and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, there are also concerns and accusations that it seeks to develop nuclear weapons for regional influence and deterrence. Given the complexity and overlapping motivations, it is reasonable to think that both aspects are involved. Therefore, I select both as the primary reasons.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Iran's pursuit of a nuclear program appears to be motivated by a combination of strategic and practical considerations. On one hand, developing nuclear energy can help meet the country's domestic energy demands and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. On the other hand, nuclear technology also provides the potential for developing nuclear weapons, which could serve as a regional deterrent and enhance Iran's strategic influence. Given the complexity of the motivations and the context of Iran's regional and international situation, it is reasonable to believe that their efforts are driven by both energy needs and strategic security concerns simultaneously.\n\nANSWER: C",

Officially, Iran emphasizes nuclear energy for domestic power needs and economic development, which aligns with option B. However, international concerns and some government statements suggest that nuclear weapons development is also a motivation, partly for regional security and deterrence, aligning with option A. Considering the evidence and the complexity of Iran's strategic goals, it is reasonable to conclude that their pursuit is motivated by both energy needs and security concerns simultaneously.\n\nANSWER: C",
