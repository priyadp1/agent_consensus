  "raw_output": "I believe that economic problems in Europe pose a minor threat to our country's economic well-being. While Europe is an important trading partner and global economic developments can influence our economy, current conditions and strategies suggest that the impact would be limited. Our country has been diversifying its markets and strengthening its internal economic resilience, which helps mitigate potential risks from European economic issues. Therefore, the threat is notable but not overwhelming, making it a minor concern overall.\n\nANSWER: B",
