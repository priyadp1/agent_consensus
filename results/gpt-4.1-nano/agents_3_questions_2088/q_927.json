        "raw_output": "I believe that President Barack Obama may have had a somewhat better understanding of Pakistan compared to many other Western leaders, partly due to his background as a constitutional lawyer and his efforts to engage diplomatically with the region during his presidency. His administration took several initiatives aimed at improving the relationship and understanding of Pakistan's complex political and security issues. However, given that understanding of a country involves nuanced and extensive knowledge, and considering the diversity among Western leaders, it\u2019s difficult to definitively say he had the \"better\" understanding than all others. Still, his efforts and background suggest he likely possessed a more informed perspective than many of his peers.\n\nANSWER: A",
