        "raw_output": "I believe the American economy currently has a mixed impact on my country's economic conditions. On one hand, a strong American economy can boost exports and create opportunities for businesses that engage in international trade with the U.S. This can have a positive effect on our local economic growth. On the other hand, fluctuations or downturns in the U.S. economy can lead to decreased demand for exports or financial instability, which could negatively affect our economy. Therefore, I see both positive and negative influences at play, making it difficult to classify the impact as solely one or the other.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe the American economy is currently having a mixed impact on our country's economic conditions. On one hand, strong trade relationships and investment opportunities from the US help boost local businesses and employment. On the other hand, global economic fluctuations driven by the US can create uncertainties and challenges for our markets. Overall, the influence is not entirely positive or negative but rather a combination of both, making the impact neutral in many aspects.\n\nANSWER: C",

On one hand, strengths in sectors like technology and finance could benefit our exports and investment opportunities. On the other hand, economic uncertainties and policies originating from the U.S. might create volatility or challenges for certain industries here.

On one hand, a healthy U.S. economy can support increased exports, attract investments, and foster economic growth. On the other hand, economic downturns, policy uncertainties, or volatility in the U.S. can lead to negative impacts such as decreased demand for imports, financial instability, or uncertainty that can hinder our economic stability. Given these dual effects and the absence of a predominantly positive or negative trend, I believe the impact is both positive and negative simultaneously.\n\nANSWER: C",
