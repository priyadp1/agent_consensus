  "question": "I'd like your opinion about the effectiveness of different ways of trying to influence what the government does. How effective is it to...contact a government official...very effective, somewhat effective, not too effective, or not at all effective?",
  "options": [
    "Very effective",
    "Somewhat effective",
    "Not too effective",
    "Not at all effective"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that contacting a government official can be quite effective because it allows citizens to directly express their concerns or opinions, potentially influencing decision-makers especially when many people do so collectively. Personal engagement can sometimes prompt officials to prioritize issues that they might not have otherwise addressed. However, the actual impact can vary depending on the issue, the official's responsiveness, and the level of public support. Overall, I see it as a meaningful way to try to influence government actions.\n\nANSWER: A",
