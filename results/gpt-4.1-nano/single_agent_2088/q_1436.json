  "question": "Would you say that U.S. aid to Pakistan is mostly military aid, mostly aid to help Pakistan develop economically or both equally?",
  "options": [
    "Mostly military",
    "Mostly to help Pakistan develop economically",
    "Both equally"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "U.S. aid to Pakistan has historically been heavily focused on military assistance, especially in the context of strategic interests such as counterterrorism and regional security. While there are economic development projects and aid programs aimed at improving Pakistan\u2019s economy, these tend to be relatively smaller in scale compared to military support. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to say that the aid is mostly military, with some economic assistance but not equally balanced.\n\nANSWER: A",
