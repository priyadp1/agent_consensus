  "options": [
    "The most assertive of the leading nations",
    "No more or less assertive than other leading nations"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the United States should adopt a stance of being no more or less assertive than other leading nations. This approach promotes international stability and cooperation by encouraging a balanced and respectful engagement with the global community. Being overly assertive could lead to unnecessary conflicts or tensions, while being less assertive might diminish the country's influence and ability to advocate for its interests effectively. Maintaining a comparable level of assertiveness allows the U.S. to lead responsibly without overshadowing or provoking other nations. \n\nANSWER: B"
