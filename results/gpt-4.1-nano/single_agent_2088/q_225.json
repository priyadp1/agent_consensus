  "question": "As a result of the U.S. military operation that killed bin Laden, do you think relations between Pakistan and the U.S. will improve, worsen or remain the same as they have been?",
  "options": [
    "Improve",
    "Worsen",
    "Remain the same"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The killing of bin Laden was a significant event with complex implications for U.S.-Pakistan relations. While it demonstrated U.S. commitment to counterterrorism and may have temporarily improved cooperation on security issues, it also heightened mistrust and suspicion within Pakistan, as many believed the operation was conducted without sufficient coordination. Given these mixed signals and underlying tensions, it's likely that relations would remain largely unchanged in the short term, with possible fluctuations rather than clear improvements or deterioration. Therefore, I believe the status quo will persist.\n\nANSWER: C"
