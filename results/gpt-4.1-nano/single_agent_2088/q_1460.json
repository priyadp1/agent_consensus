Germany has been increasingly diverse and open to individuals of different backgrounds. The country\u2019s political landscape has shown signs of becoming more inclusive, and there are already examples of politicians with diverse origins holding significant positions. As societal attitudes continue to evolve towards greater acceptance and inclusivity, and as political parties adopt more diverse candidates, it is reasonable to believe that such a scenario could occur sooner rather than later.\n\nANSWER: A",
