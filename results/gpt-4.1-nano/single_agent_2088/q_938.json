  "question": "Now turning to different topic, if the your country government and other leading countries cannot agree on policies to protect the global environment, which should have the final say",
  "options": [
    "(Survey Country) government",
    "International organization such as the UN"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "In situations where national governments cannot reach an agreement on environmental policies, it is important to consider the need for a neutral and globally accountable authority that can enforce measures for the common good. An international organization like the UN has the broader perspective and legitimacy to represent global interests, ensuring that environmental protection is prioritized collectively rather than being hindered by individual national priorities. This approach promotes consistency, equity, and accountability in addressing global environmental challenges that transcend borders. Therefore, it makes sense for an international organization to have the final say in such disputes to ensure effective and equitable environmental protection worldwide.\n\nANSWER: B",
