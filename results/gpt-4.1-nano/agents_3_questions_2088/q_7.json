Its impact can vary depending on the level of pollution and local circumstances, but in general, it is perceived as a major concern that affects a large portion of the population. Given its widespread effects on health, quality of life, and the environment, I would consider it a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Air pollution is a significant concern in many countries, including our own. It affects people's health, especially vulnerable populations like children and the elderly, and can contribute to serious diseases such as asthma, lung attacks, and heart problems. Additionally, air pollution impacts the environment, damaging ecosystems and reducing the quality of life. Given these considerations, I believe air pollution is a very big problem because it has widespread health, environmental, and economic consequences that need urgent attention.\n\nANSWER: A",

In my view, while it is a serious issue, it may not always be perceived as the most urgent or pressing problem compared to other challenges like economic stability or healthcare access. However, its effects are long-term and widespread, making it a notable problem but perhaps not the absolute top priority for everyone. Therefore, I think it is a moderately big problem.\nANSWER: B",
