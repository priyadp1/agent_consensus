        "raw_output": "There is reason to believe that water pollution may worsen over the next five years due to ongoing industrialization, population growth, and climate change impacts that can increase contamination and strain water management systems. Although efforts to improve water quality are ongoing, the pace of technological advances and policy implementation may not be fast enough to prevent deterioration, especially in less regulated regions. Therefore, I think water pollution will get worse.\n\nANSWER: B",

Although there are efforts to improve water quality, progress can be slow and inconsistent, so I think the overall situation might deteriorate before it improves. \n\nANSWER: B",

Without significant policy changes and enforcement, efforts to reduce pollution might not keep pace with the increase in contamination sources.
