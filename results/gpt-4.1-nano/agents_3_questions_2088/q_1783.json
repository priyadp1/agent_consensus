        "raw_output": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most enduring and complex disputes in the Middle East, with potential to disrupt regional stability. Its volatility can influence neighboring countries, spill over into broader Middle Eastern conflicts, and attract international attention and intervention, which can escalate tensions globally. While efforts toward peace have advanced at times, ongoing issues such as border disputes, resource allocations, and political instability pose significant risks. Given these factors, the conflict can be seen as a great danger to both regional stability and, by extension, global peace.\n\nANSWER: A",
