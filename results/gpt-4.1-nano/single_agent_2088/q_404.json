  "question": "For each of the following statements about the missile strikes, please tell me whether you agree or disagree. They are being done without the approval of the Pakistani government.",
  "options": [
    "Agree",
    "Disagree"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "My reasoning is that conducting missile strikes without the approval of the Pakistani government raises questions about transparency, sovereignty, and adherence to official procedures. If such actions are indeed carried out independently or without official consent, it could indicate a breach of national authority and potentially undermine diplomatic relations or security protocols. Therefore, I lean towards believing that these strikes are being done without formal approval of the government, making the statement likely to be accurate from the perspective of maintaining official oversight and legality.\n\nANSWER: A"
