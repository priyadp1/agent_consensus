        "raw_output": "My perception of whether the European Union understands the needs of my nationality\u2019s citizens depends on various factors such as recent policies, communication efforts, and the effectiveness of initiatives aimed at addressing specific issues. If I feel that the EU actively engages with my community, listens to our concerns, and implements suitable measures, I might believe they understand our needs. Conversely, if I perceive that they overlook our unique challenges or fail to address our priorities, I would think they do not understand. Given the complexity and diversity within the EU, my view may lean towards uncertainty or limited confidence, but without specific context, I would choose based on general impressions.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "My perception of the European Union's understanding of my nationality's needs depends on how well I think its policies and actions align with those needs. If I believe the EU actively considers and addresses the specific concerns of my fellow citizens, I would choose \"Yes.\" If I feel that the EU neglects or overlooks these needs, then \"No\" would be appropriate. Given the complexity and diverse interests within the EU, perceptions may vary, and some may remain unsure or hesitant to judge definitively. Since I do believe that the EU has made some efforts to understand my country's needs but also recognizes room for improvement, I would lean towards the belief that it understands to some extent. Therefore, I select:\n\nANSWER: A",

This can sometimes lead to perceptions that it does not fully understand all individual needs.
