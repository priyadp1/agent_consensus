        "raw_output": "Supporting missile strikes against leaders of extremist groups may be justified as a means to disrupt their operations and protect civilians, especially if diplomatic solutions are insufficient. However, such actions also carry risks of escalating violence, causing unintended civilian casualties, and damaging international relations. It is important to weigh the potential security benefits against the moral and humanitarian costs. Given these complexities, I would lean toward opposing missile strikes to prevent further escalation and loss of innocent lives.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Conducting missile strikes against leaders of extremist groups in Pakistan is a complex issue. Supporters might argue that such strikes can weaken these groups and prevent future attacks, thus enhancing regional security. Opponents, however, might contend that missile strikes could lead to civilian casualties, escalate tensions, and destabilize the region further, potentially fueling more extremism. Given the potential for unintended consequences and the importance of respecting sovereignty, I would oppose such actions without extensive diplomatic efforts and careful consideration of the broader impacts.\n\nANSWER: B",
