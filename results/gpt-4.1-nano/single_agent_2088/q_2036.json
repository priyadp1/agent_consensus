    "No answer"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "In some cultures and families, a woman working outside the home may challenge traditional gender roles, which could lead to conflicts with in-laws who hold more conservative or traditional views. These disagreements might stem from perceptions of a woman's domestic responsibilities or societal expectations. However, this outcome is not universal and depends on individual family dynamics and cultural context. Therefore, I think it is somewhat likely that such conflicts could occur.\n\nANSWER: B",
