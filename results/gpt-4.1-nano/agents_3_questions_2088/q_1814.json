        "raw_output": "I believe that India's laws should strike a balance between being stringent enough to serve as a deterrent and ensuring that justice is served fairly. While recent legal reforms aim to speed up trials and impose harsher punishments, there is still a perception that enforcement may not always be consistent, and some cases may not result in proportionate consequences. Therefore, it appears that the laws are not yet as tough as they need to be to effectively deter and punish such crimes, but they are moving in the right direction. Given this, I think the laws are not tough enough to address the severity and prevalence of rape adequately.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe that while India's laws regarding rape are stringent on paper, their implementation often falls short due to delays, corruption, and societal factors. To truly deter such crimes and ensure justice, the laws need not only to be tough but also to be effectively enforced. Therefore, I think they are not tough enough in practice, even if the legal framework exists. Strengthening enforcement mechanisms and ensuring swift justice is crucial.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "India's laws regarding the punishment for rape have historically been a subject of debate. While there have been significant legal reforms to strengthen penalties and close gaps in the justice system, there are still concerns about the implementation and effectiveness of these laws. Some believe that the laws may be too lenient or not sufficiently enforced, leading to frustration among victims and advocates. Others argue that the laws are already stringent and that issues lie more with social attitudes and judicial processes. Overall, I believe the legal framework requires ongoing review and improvement to ensure justice is effectively delivered, but current laws are generally not too lenient. Therefore, I think they are about right, though real change depends on enforcement and societal attitudes.\n\nANSWER: C",

This suggests that the laws are not enforced as rigorously as they should be, allowing some offenders to evade strict punishment.

Given that some laws are perceived as insufficiently enforced or not stringent enough to serve as effective deterrents, I think the laws are not tough enough to address the severity and prevalence of rape adequately.
