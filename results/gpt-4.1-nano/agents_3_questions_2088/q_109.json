        "raw_output": "I believe this is a somewhat important reason because motivation can influence employment status, but it's not the sole factor. Many people face barriers beyond motivation, such as economic conditions or lack of opportunities. Therefore, while being unmotivated or lazy can contribute, it might not be the primary or most significant reason for unemployment for many individuals.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe this is somewhat important because individual motivation can influence whether someone seeks or maintains employment. While laziness might be a factor for some, others may face external barriers that diminish personal motivation. Therefore, considering motivation as a reason for unemployment is relevant but perhaps not the most critical aspect. \n\nANSWER: B",

While laziness may be a factor for some, it is generally one of many complex reasons behind unemployment, and external factors often play a significant role. Therefore, recognizing motivation as relevant but not the primary cause seems appropriate.\n\nANSWER: B",
