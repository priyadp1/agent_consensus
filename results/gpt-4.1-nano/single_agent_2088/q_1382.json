  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Large movements of people between countries can be viewed differently depending on the context and individual perspectives. Some may see it as a major threat due to concerns about economic impact, security, or cultural changes, while others might view it as a minor issue or not a threat at all, especially if it is managed well or seen as an opportunity. Personally, I believe that unless there are significant disruptions or security concerns, large-scale migration is generally not a major threat to my country. It can sometimes bring positive contributions to society, such as cultural diversity and economic growth, depending on how it is handled.\n\nANSWER: C",
