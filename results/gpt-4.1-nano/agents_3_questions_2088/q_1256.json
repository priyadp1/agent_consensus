        "raw_output": "Many people believe that higher income individuals have excessive influence in our political system because they often have more resources to fund campaigns, lobby, and sway policy decisions. This can lead to a disproportionate voice that outweighs the concerns of the average citizen, potentially undermining the principles of equal representation. While some argue that their influence is necessary for economic growth and development, the perception that wealth translates directly to political power raises concerns about fairness and democracy. Therefore, I think they have too much influence.\n\nANSWER: A",

This is because they often have greater resources to donate to campaigns, lobby for policies that benefit their interests, and access to policymakers, which can lead to an imbalance where their priorities overshadow those of the broader population.

This is because wealthier individuals often have greater access to politicians, funding for campaigns, and sway over policy decisions, which can skew the democratic process in favor of their interests. While their contributions can support political activity and civic engagement, the disproportionate influence they wield can diminish the representation of average citizens and those with less economic power. Ideally, the influence in our political system should be more balanced to ensure a fairer voice for all socioeconomic groups.\n\nANSWER: A",
