President Maduro's handling of energy policy has been marked by efforts to maintain oil production levels amid economic difficulties, but there have also been concerns about mismanagement and lack of investment in renewable energy initiatives. Given these factors, I might be inclined to disapprove due to ongoing issues and perceived missteps, but recognize some effort is being made. \n\nANSWER: B",
