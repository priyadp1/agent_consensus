  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the growing gap between the rich and the poor poses the greatest threat to the world because it can lead to increased social instability, political unrest, and economic inequality. When wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, it often results in limited access to resources and opportunities for the majority, which can exacerbate other problems such as health crises and environmental degradation. Addressing this disparity is crucial for fostering social cohesion and sustainable development.\n\nANSWER: C"
