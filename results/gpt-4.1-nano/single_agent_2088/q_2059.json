  "question": "What about these forms of political action and social activism that people can take?. Please, tell me for each of them if you have done any of these things, whether you might do it or would never under any circumstances do it:\n\nVote for a demobilized as a congressman",
  "options": [
    "Have done",
    "Might do",
    "Would never do"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe voting is an important part of democratic participation, and I would support voting for qualified candidates regardless of their current activity status. Since \"demobilized\" suggests they are inactive, I might consider voting for them if I believe they still have the capability to serve effectively. Therefore, I would choose the option that indicates I might do it.\n\nANSWER: B",
