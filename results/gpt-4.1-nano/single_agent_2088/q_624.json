  "raw_output": "The court system plays a crucial role in maintaining justice and ensuring the rule of law in the country. In some cases, it has contributed positively by upholding rights and providing fair judgments, which fosters trust among citizens. However, there are also concerns about delays, corruption, or perceived biases that diminish its effectiveness and fairness. Overall, while the system has its strengths, the perceptions of its influence are mixed, leaning more towards the negative side for many people. Therefore, I believe the influence of the court system is somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C"
