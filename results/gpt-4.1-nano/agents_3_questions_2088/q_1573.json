        "raw_output": "The decision to not adopt the Euro as our currency can have various implications depending on the country's economic structure, independence, and financial stability. Maintaining our own currency allows for greater control over monetary policy, potentially helping to address specific economic challenges and respond quickly to crises. It also avoids the risks associated with sharing a common currency with other nations that may have different economic circumstances. On the other hand, not using the Euro might lead to exchange rate volatility and increased transaction costs, which could hinder trade and investment. Overall, whether it has been a good or bad thing depends on how effectively the country manages its monetary policy and economic needs. Considering these factors, many might view the ability to tailor economic policy as a significant advantage, making it more beneficial than harmful. Therefore, I would lean toward the opinion that not having the Euro has been a good thing overall.\n\nANSWER: A",
