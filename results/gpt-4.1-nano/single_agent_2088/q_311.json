  "question": "Do you think most Muslims in our country today want to adopt \nyour country\u2019s customs and way of life or do you think that they want to be distinct from the larger society?",
  "options": [
    "Adopt customs",
    "Want to be distinct",
    "Both (VOL)",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "My reasoning is based on the understanding that Muslim communities are diverse and their approach to integrating with the broader society varies. Some may seek to adopt many local customs and participate actively in the national culture, aiming for assimilation and shared identity. Others may prioritize maintaining distinct cultural, religious, or traditional practices to preserve their community identity and values, even if it sets them apart from mainstream society. Given this diversity, it is accurate to recognize that both attitudes coexist among Muslims in our country, rather than a singular approach.\n\nANSWER: C"
