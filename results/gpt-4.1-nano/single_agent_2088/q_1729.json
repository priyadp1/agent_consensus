    "Good",

  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Fidel Castro's leadership in Cuba is a complex and debated topic. On one hand, he implemented significant social programs like universal healthcare and education that benefited many Cubans. On the other hand, his governance was marked by political repression, lack of political freedoms, and economic hardships that affected the populace. Considering both the positive social achievements and the negatives related to political rights and economic conditions, I believe his impact has been mixed, making it difficult to label him strictly as good or bad without context. Therefore, I select the neutral option.\n\nANSWER: C",
