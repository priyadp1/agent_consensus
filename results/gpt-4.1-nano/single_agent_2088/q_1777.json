Violence often perpetuates cycles of hatred and suffering, making it difficult to reach peaceful solutions or foster understanding between groups. While I understand there may be complex political or social grievances behind these actions, I do not think violence is an acceptable or justified means to address them.\n\nANSWER: B",
