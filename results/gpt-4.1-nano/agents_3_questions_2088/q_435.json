For some, it can be seen as a form of entertainment or a personal choice that doesn't inherently carry moral weight. However, in other circumstances, gambling can lead to addiction, financial hardship, and social harm, which makes it morally questionable. Since the morality of gambling varies based on individual circumstances and intentions, I think it is not a clear-cut moral issue but rather depends on the specific situation.\n\nANSWER: D",

For some, gambling is a form of entertainment and personal choice, and it can be conducted responsibly without harm to others.
