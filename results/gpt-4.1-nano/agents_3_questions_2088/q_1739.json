        "raw_output": "I believe our government does not align closely enough with U.S. policies, perhaps due to disagreements or a desire to maintain independence. This suggests that we might benefit from more cooperation or alignment with U.S. policies to strengthen diplomatic and economic relations. Therefore, I think they deal with the U.S. just about right may not reflect the current stance accurately, but most likely, they go along too much or not enough. Since I lean towards the idea that they could be more aligned, I choose not enough.\n\nANSWER: B",

While sometimes supporting U.S. initiatives can be necessary, there should also be room for independent decision-making to ensure our country's sovereignty and tailored strategies.

        "raw_output": "Based on observed public sentiment, many people feel that their government tends to capitulate too readily to U.S. policies, possibly compromising local interests or sovereignty. Others believe that the government is either too resistant or appropriately balanced in its dealings. Considering the current political climate and regional attitudes toward U.S. influence, the most common viewpoint is that the government aligns too closely, possibly at the expense of independent decision-making. Therefore, the most appropriate choice reflects the perception that the government goes along with U.S. policies too much.\n\nANSWER: A",

While maintaining good international relationships is important, it is also vital for national sovereignty to retain some autonomy in decision-making rather than following U.S. policies too closely.
