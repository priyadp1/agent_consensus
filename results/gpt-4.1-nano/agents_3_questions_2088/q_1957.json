Depending on the candidate's priorities and approach, there could be positive changes that improve international relations, or there may be uncertainties that could temporarily worsen perceptions and alliances. Overall, while some adjustments are expected, substantial shifts may take time, and the overall impact might not be drastic right away. Therefore, I think the change will not be very significant.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Predicting the future of US foreign policy is inherently challenging because it depends on numerous unpredictable factors, including the incoming administration's priorities, global geopolitical developments, and international crises. Historically, new presidents often introduce some changes, but these tend to be incremental rather than drastic shifts, especially in established foreign policies that are deeply rooted in longstanding national interests. While some voters hope the new administration will improve diplomatic relations, others worry about potential setbacks or increased conflicts. Given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding policy shifts, I believe the most realistic expectation is that there will be some changes, but not enough to constitute a significant overall improvement or deterioration.\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe that the outcome of US foreign policy after a new president takes office can vary depending on the candidate's priorities and approach. However, historically, changes in leadership often lead to shifts in foreign policy that are not always predictable\u2014some may be positive, fostering better international cooperation, while others could lead to increased tensions. Given this, I think it is more realistic to expect that the policy might not change that much unless the new administration has a significantly different approach. Therefore, I choose the option indicating minimal change, as many foreign policy elements tend to remain consistent over time despite leadership changes.\n\nANSWER: C",

Major shifts often require sustained effort and are influenced by global circumstances beyond individual leadership. Therefore, I think that the foreign policy next year will likely not change that much, as most foundational policies and international commitments are maintained regardless of leadership transitions.\n\nANSWER: C",
