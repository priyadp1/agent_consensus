  "question": "In your opinion, which of the following better explains why the U.S. might use military force against Iraq? Is it more because the U.S. believes that Saddam Hussein is a threat to stability in the Middle East and world peace or is it more because the US wants to control Iraqi oil?",
  "options": [
    "Threat to stability",
    "Control Iraqi oil",
    "Both"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "In my opinion, the primary reason why the U.S. might use military force against Iraq is because it perceives Saddam Hussein as a threat to stability in the Middle East and world peace. The rhetoric surrounding the invasion often emphasized concerns about WMDs and regional instability, which could have broader global ramifications. While control of Iraqi oil might be a factor for some policymakers, I believe the main justification highlighted publicly has been national and international security concerns. Therefore, I see the issue as predominantly about threat perception rather than economic interests. \n\nANSWER: A"
