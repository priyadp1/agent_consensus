  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can influence wages for workers of my nationality depending on various factors. Generally, increased trade can lead to economic growth and higher demand for certain skills, which might raise wages in some sectors. However, it can also result in job competition from cheaper foreign labor, potentially putting downward pressure on wages for some workers. The overall impact is mixed and context-dependent, so it does not have a clear, universal effect. Therefore, I believe trade does not make a definitive difference in wages for my nationality workers. \n\nANSWER: C",
