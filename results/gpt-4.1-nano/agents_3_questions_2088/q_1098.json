While security concerns are valid, evidence suggests that the vast majority of refugees are fleeing violence and persecution and do not pose a threat. Moreover, associating refugees with terrorism can stigmatize innocent individuals and overlook the benefits of providing safe haven. Therefore, I align more with the view that refugees will not increase the likelihood of terrorism here.\n\nANSWER: B",

Most refugees are fleeing violence and persecution and seek safety, and there is little evidence to suggest that their presence leads to higher terrorism risks. Additionally, focusing on responsible integration and security measures can mitigate any potential concerns.

While concerns about security are valid, evidence from past instances suggests that refugees are often fleeing from violence and persecution, and their contributions can be beneficial. Moreover, associating refugees broadly with terrorism can lead to unfair stigmatization and ignores the importance of thorough vetting processes and integration efforts.

Evidence from multiple studies suggests that refugees are primarily fleeing violence and persecution, and there is no strong justification for assuming they are more likely to commit acts of terrorism.
