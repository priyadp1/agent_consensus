  "question": "Please tell me if you agree or disagree with the following statement...Men get more opportunities than women for jobs that pay well, even when women are as qualified as men for the job",
  "options": [
    "Completely agree",
    "Mostly agree",
    "Mostly disagree",
    "Completely disagree"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Many studies and personal experiences suggest that men often have more opportunities for high-paying jobs compared to women, even when women have equal qualifications. This discrepancy can be influenced by gender biases, workplace culture, and societal expectations that favor men in certain industries or roles. While progress has been made, the perception and reality of unequal opportunities remain relevant, making me lean toward the view that men generally get more opportunities than women in such scenarios.\n\nANSWER: B"
