  "question": "Overall do you think it would be a good thing or a bad thing if China were to become as powerful militarily as the US?",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "A significant increase in China's military power to match that of the US could potentially lead to heightened global tensions and an arms race, which might destabilize international peace and security. While it could also mean a shift in global power dynamics that some might see as a form of balance, the risks of conflict and regional instability generally outweigh the benefits. Therefore, I believe it would be more harmful than beneficial for China to become as militarily powerful as the US.\n\nANSWER: B"
