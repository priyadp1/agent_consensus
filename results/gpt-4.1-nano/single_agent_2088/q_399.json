  "question": "And as a consequence of the war, do you have more confidence or less confidence that the US wants to promote democracy all around the world?",
  "options": [
    "More",
    "Less",
    "Same (VOL.)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "My perception of the US's intentions regarding promoting democracy worldwide could be influenced by the war's effects. If the war has led to increased skepticism about US motives\u2014perhaps due to perceptions of military intervention or geopolitical interests overshadowing democratic values\u2014I might have less confidence. Conversely, if the war underscores the US's commitment to democracy, I could have more confidence. Given the complexity and potential doubts raised by conflicts, my inclination is to believe that trust might decrease overall because wars often generate skepticism about international motives. Therefore, I lean toward less confidence in the US's promotion of democracy after the war.\n\nANSWER: B"
