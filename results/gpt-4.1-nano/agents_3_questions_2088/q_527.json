Even if my immediate area seems generally safe, specific spots like poorly lit alleyways or isolated parks might make me hesitant to walk alone at night. Personal experiences and local crime rates influence this perception, so I acknowledge that there could be areas within a mile where I would feel unsafe. Ensuring a safe environment for all residents is important, and it's natural to have some apprehension about certain spots during nighttime hours.\n\nANSWER: A",

Additionally, some neighborhoods nearby have a history of petty crimes or vandalism, increasing my concern about personal safety when alone at night. Therefore, I believe there are areas close to my home where I might feel apprehensive about walking alone after dark.\n\nANSWER: A",
