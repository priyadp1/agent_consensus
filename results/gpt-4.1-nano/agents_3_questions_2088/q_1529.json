Such actions result in innocent people suffering and do not represent a legitimate or ethical way to defend a faith or community. True defense and advocacy should be pursued through peaceful dialogue, understanding, and lawful means. Employing violence only perpetuates suffering and fosters further conflict, undermining the principles of compassion and justice that many religions, including Islam, promote.

While I understand that some may feel that extreme measures are a response to threat or aggression, I hold that peaceful and lawful means are the appropriate way to defend any beliefs, including Islam. Using violence against innocent people ultimately undermines the principles of justice and compassion that are central to many faiths, including Islam.
