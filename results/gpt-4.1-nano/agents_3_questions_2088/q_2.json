        "raw_output": "While China has made significant economic and geopolitical strides, surpassing the U.S. as the world's leading superpower within the next 10 or 20 years seems unlikely due to the scale of economic, military, technological, and political differences, as well as the complexities involved in such a transition. Over a longer horizon like 50 years, future developments in global stability, innovation, and international relations could alter the landscape, but current trajectories suggest the U.S. will maintain its superpower status for the foreseeable future. Therefore, I believe China will not replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "I believe China could potentially replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower within the next 50 years due to its rapid economic growth, expanding technological capabilities, and increasing global influence. However, significant challenges such as political governance issues, demographic changes, and international tensions could slow or prevent this transition. Given the complexity and unpredictability of geopolitical developments, I think it's uncertain whether this shift will occur sooner or later, but over a longer timeframe, the possibility remains plausible.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "Considering current economic, technological, military, and geopolitical trends, it is uncertain whether China will fully surpass the United States as the world's leading superpower within the next few decades. While China's rapid growth and strategic investments suggest significant influence, the U.S. still maintains a substantial advantage in innovation, military strength, and global alliances. Over the next 10 to 20 years, China may rival or challenge U.S. dominance in certain areas, but a complete replacement within that timeframe seems unlikely. Over a longer horizon such as 50 years, unpredictable developments could shift the balance, but the probability of a total overtaking remains uncertain. Therefore, it is most realistic to believe that the U.S. will retain its superpower status for the foreseeable future.  \nANSWER: D",

However, the United States still maintains a significant edge in military power, innovation, and international alliances, which are crucial for superpower status. While a shift could occur over a longer period, the pace and complexity of geopolitical change make it unlikely that China will fully replace the U.S. within the next 10 or 20 years. The most plausible outlook is that China might rival or challenge U.S. influence in certain areas over the next few decades, but not entirely supplant it imminently.

        "raw_output": "Given current geopolitical, economic, and military trends, China has certainly increased its global influence and showcases impressive growth. However, surpassing the U.S. as the world's leading superpower involves complex factors including innovation, military dominance, political stability, international alliances, and soft power\u2014areas where the U.S. still maintains a significant lead. While China may challenge U.S. dominance in specific regions or spheres over the next two decades, the trajectory toward complete replacement within 10 or 20 years appears unlikely given the scale of the existing global order and institutional advantages the U.S. has built. Over a longer span like 50 years, unforeseen developments could alter the balance, but based on current trajectories, the most probable scenario is that the U.S. retains its superpower status for the foreseeable future.  \nANSWER: D",

However, the timeline is uncertain due to potential political, demographic, and international challenges that could slow this process. While a shift could happen within the longer-term horizon, it seems less likely within the next 10 or 20 years, given the size and complexity of the transition.

        "raw_output": "Given the current geopolitical, economic, and military landscape, China has demonstrated impressive growth and has increased its influence globally. However, surpassing the U.S. as the leading superpower involves overcoming significant structural, institutional, and soft power advantages that the U.S. currently holds. These include military dominance, technological innovation, international alliances, and cultural influence. While China might close the gap and challenge U.S. supremacy regionally or in specific sectors over the next few decades, the idea of complete replacement within 10 or 20 years seems optimistic considering the scale of the U.S. global leadership framework. Over a longer horizon like 50 years, numerous unforeseen factors could influence this balance, but given our current trajectory and existing advantages, it appears unlikely that China will fully replace the U.S. as the world's top superpower within the next two decades.  \nANSWER: D",

However, the United States still maintains substantial advantages in military strength, innovation, and international leadership, which are critical for superpower status.
