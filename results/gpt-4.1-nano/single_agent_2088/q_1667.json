  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the Mexican government has made some efforts to combat drug traffickers, such as increased military interventions and law enforcement actions. However, despite these measures, drug-related violence and trafficking activities continue to persist and even escalate in some regions, suggesting that they are not making sufficient progress. The ongoing challenges and setbacks indicate that the situation has remained relatively stable or possibly worsened over time. Therefore, I think they are losing ground in this campaign.\n\nANSWER: B",
