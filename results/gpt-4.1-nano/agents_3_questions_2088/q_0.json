As the strongest economy in Europe, Germany naturally plays a significant role in shaping EU policies and decisions. While some may argue that Germany's influence could be seen as excessive, it is important for balance and stability within the EU that member states like Germany have a fair say in collective decision-making. An influence that is neither too dominant nor too weak helps facilitate effective collaboration among member nations.
