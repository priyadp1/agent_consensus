        "raw_output": "In my view, the progress of the Philippine government's campaign against illegal drugs is difficult to assess definitively. While there have been efforts and some measures taken, reports of ongoing violence, extrajudicial actions, and concerns about human rights violations suggest that substantial challenges remain. It seems that the campaign has not significantly improved the situation and might be losing ground in terms of public trust and efficacy. Therefore, I believe things are roughly the same as they have been in the past, with no clear sign of progress or regression that could be firmly established.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that the Philippine government is losing ground in its campaign against illegal drugs because despite efforts and some notable operations, the problem persists with high levels of drug-related crimes, ongoing supply, and enforcement challenges. The complexity of the issue and reports of continued drug activities suggest that progress is limited and the situation has not significantly improved compared to the past.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The Philippine government's efforts against illegal drugs have seen some initial successes, such as increased police operations and societal awareness. However, concerns about human rights violations, unsteady progress, and persistent illegal drug activities suggest that while there may be some advancements, overall the situation remains challenging and not clearly better than before. Therefore, I believe that the campaign is probably losing ground or at best, has remained about the same, but not substantially improved.\nANSWER: B",

The complex nature of the issue and reports of persistent illegal activities suggest the situation remains difficult and improvements are limited.

Although there have been efforts and some initial successes, the overall situation seems not to have improved significantly.

While efforts have been made, the persistent issues indicate limited progress.

While there may have been some efforts, the overall situation hasn't significantly changed, and illegal drug problems remain prevalent. Therefore, I believe the government is making progress but not enough to substantially alter the situation. However, given the choices, the most fitting is that things are about the same as they've been in the past, as progress seems minimal and inconsistent.\n\nANSWER: C",
