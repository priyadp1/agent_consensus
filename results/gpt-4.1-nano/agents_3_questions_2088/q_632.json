        "raw_output": "In my opinion, the sanctions should be kept about the same as they are now. While additional sanctions might increase pressure, they could also deepen economic hardship for ordinary people and risk escalating tensions further. Conversely, decreasing sanctions might reduce suffering but could also undermine diplomatic efforts or signal weakness. Maintaining the current level allows for a balanced approach, preserving pressure while avoiding excessive harm or escalation. Therefore, keeping the sanctions at their current level seems the most prudent course of action.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "In my view, maintaining the current level of sanctions serves as a balanced approach, providing enough pressure to encourage change while avoiding further escalation that could harm civilians or worsen diplomatic relations. Increasing sanctions might create additional hardship and deepen tensions, whereas decreasing them could reduce pressure on authorities and potentially undermine efforts to influence positive change. Therefore, keeping the sanctions about the same ensures a measured response aligned with diplomatic strategies and humanitarian considerations.\n\nANSWER: C",
