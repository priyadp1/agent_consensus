    "Very serious",
    "Somewhat serious",
    "Not too serious",
    "Not a problem at all",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The loss of U.S. jobs to China has been a significant concern for many Americans, especially as manufacturing jobs have declined over the years and economic integration has increased. While some believe that job loss is a serious problem that affects workers and communities, others may see it as a natural part of global economic shifts or worry about job creation and overall economic health. Overall, I believe it is a problem that warrants attention but might not be universally devastating across all sectors. Therefore, I would consider it somewhat serious.\n\nANSWER: B"
