  "raw_output": "The breakup of Czechoslovakia allowed for greater self-determination and local governance, which can lead to policies better suited to each nation's needs. It also helped reduce ethnic tensions that were more complicated to manage within a single state, fostering more stable and cohesive societies in the long term. While there are some challenges associated with the division, overall, it provided an opportunity for both nations to pursue their own paths and develop more tailored economic and political strategies. Therefore, I believe it was a positive development.\n\nANSWER: A"
