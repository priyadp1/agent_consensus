  "question": "Why is it that American policy is having a negative effect on our country? Is it mostly because of President George W. Bush or is it more a general problem with America?",
  "options": [
    "Bush",
    "America generally",
    "Both (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The negative effects of American policy can often be attributed to broader systemic issues within the country, such as political polarization, economic inequality, and entrenched institutional challenges. While President George W. Bush's policies and decisions certainly played a significant role during his tenure, these problems tend to be part of deeper, ongoing patterns that have persisted beyond any single administration. Therefore, it seems more accurate to see this as a more general problem with America rather than solely the result of one president's actions.\n\nANSWER: B",
