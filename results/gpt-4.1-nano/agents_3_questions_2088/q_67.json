In some places, the government plays a significant role in regulating daily activities, services, and economic matters, which I see as necessary for societal stability. In others, there seems to be less involvement, allowing individuals more freedom. Overall, I think the government does have considerable influence, but I also value personal autonomy. Therefore, I would choose mostly agree because I see a notable, but not overwhelming, level of control.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe that the level of government control varies depending on the country and context, but in many modern societies, the government does play a significant role in regulating daily life through laws, policies, and public services. This can range from transportation and education to healthcare and business regulations. While some people may feel that this is necessary for social order and progress, others might see it as overreach and infringements on personal freedoms. Personally, I think that although government involvement is essential in certain areas, an excessive amount of control can limit individual liberty and innovation. Therefore, I lean towards the view that the state controls too much of our daily lives.\n\nANSWER: B",
