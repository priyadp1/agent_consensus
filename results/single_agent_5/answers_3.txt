Question 3
Do you think China will replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower in the next 10 years, the next 20 years, the next 50 years, or do you think China will not replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower?

I believe that China will not fully replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower within the next 50 years. While China's rapid economic growth, technological advancements, and expanding global influence suggest it may challenge U.S. dominance sooner rather than later, several factors temper this outlook. The U.S. benefits from a strong, resilient political and technological infrastructure, extensive global alliances, and cultural influence that are difficult to surpass quickly. Additionally, demographic trends and potential geopolitical complications could slow China's rise. Therefore, I think the U.S. will maintain its superpower status longer-term, though China’s influence will likely continue to grow significantly.
