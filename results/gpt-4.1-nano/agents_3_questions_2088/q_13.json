        "raw_output": "I believe the U.S. should remove its troops as soon as possible. Prolonged military presence can lead to increased tensions and unintended consequences, and it's important to prioritize diplomatic solutions and support for rebuilding efforts. Remaining overly involved militarily may also risk further instability or casualties. Ultimately, the focus should be on helping Iraq achieve long-term stability through diplomatic and economic avenues rather than ongoing military intervention.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that the U.S. should keep its troops in Iraq until the situation has stabilized because a stable environment is crucial for long-term peace and reconstruction. Removing troops too early could lead to a resurgence of violence or terrorism, undermining efforts to build a secure and functioning society. Maintaining a military presence can provide necessary support for Iraqi security forces and help prevent chaos or an insurgency from taking hold again. Once stability is firmly established, then a phased withdrawal can be considered to ensure that Iraqi sovereignty is genuinely achieved without risking a setback.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "The decision to keep or remove troops hinges on balancing the goal of ensuring stability in Iraq with the desire to prevent prolonged military presence. If the situation has sufficiently stabilized, remaining troops can help solidify peace and prevent insurgency resurgence. Conversely, if the situation remains unstable and continued military presence risks further conflict or diplomatic issues, it might be better to expedite withdrawal. Ultimately, prioritizing the safety of both the Iraqi population and the troops, along with diplomatic and strategic considerations, suggests that the U.S. should carefully evaluate the current conditions and act accordingly. Without knowing the exact stabilization status, a cautious approach would lean toward withdrawing troops once it is reasonably safe, but until then, maintaining a presence might be necessary. \n\nANSWER: A",

An early withdrawal could risk instability and give insurgent groups an opportunity to regain power. Therefore, I support keeping U.S. troops until Iraqi authorities can effectively sustain security on their own.

Maintaining troops until the situation has genuinely stabilized can help prevent a resurgence of conflict and support long-term peace efforts. However, once stability is achieved, a responsible and strategic withdrawal would be appropriate to reduce tensions and avoid prolonged military presence. Therefore, I support keeping troops until stabilization is confirmed, after which a timely withdrawal should follow.\n\nANSWER: A",

While immediate withdrawal might risk instability and insurgency resurgence, prolonged military presence can escalate tensions and divert focus from diplomatic and reconstruction efforts. It's essential to support Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and security through a phased and conditions-based withdrawal, ensuring stability is genuinely achieved before leaving. This balanced approach minimizes risks and promotes long-term peace.\n\nANSWER: B",

A phased and conditions-based approach allows for patience and verification of security improvements, ensuring that Iraqi authorities are prepared to maintain order on their own before the U.S. withdraws completely.
