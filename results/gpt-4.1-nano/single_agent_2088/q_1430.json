  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The relationship between Muslims around the world and people in Western countries such as the United States and Europe is complex and varies depending on current events, political climates, and social factors. While there are efforts towards mutual understanding and cooperation, tensions, misunderstandings, and incidents of discrimination or conflict also persist. Overall, these dynamics suggest that the relations are not consistently positive or negative but fluctuate over time. Therefore, I believe they are generally bad because of the ongoing conflicts, stereotyping, and prejudice that still exist in many areas.\n\nANSWER: B",
