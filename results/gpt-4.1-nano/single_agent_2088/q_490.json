  "question": "In general, do you think the Saudi Arabian government favors or opposes democracy in the Middle East? ",
  "options": [
    "Favors",
    "Opposes",
    "Both/neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The Saudi Arabian government has historically maintained an autocratic governance style and has often been cautious or resistant towards democratic movements, especially in the Middle East, due to concerns over stability and its political structure. While there may be some cooperative engagement with democratic principles in specific contexts, overall, the government tends to oppose efforts that threaten its authority or lead to democratic reforms that could challenge the monarchy. Therefore, I believe they generally oppose democracy in the Middle East.\n\nANSWER: B"
