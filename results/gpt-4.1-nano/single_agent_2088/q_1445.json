  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the decision regarding the migration of EU citizens into the country should primarily be made by the EU, as migration policies often involve multiple member states and require coordination at the supranational level to ensure fair and uniform standards across the region. Allowing the EU to set these policies can help address common challenges such as labor markets, social integration, and security more effectively than individual countries acting alone. Therefore, I think the EU should make decisions about this issue.\n\nANSWER: B",
