  "options": [
    "Very effective",
    "Somewhat effective",
    "Not too effective",
    "Not at all effective"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Voting in an election is generally considered a fundamental way for citizens to have a say in government decision-making. While it may not always lead to immediate or dramatic change, it is a crucial form of participation that can influence policies and leadership over time. People who vote can help shape government actions by choosing representatives aligned with their views, and a high voter turnout can signal public support or concern on various issues. Therefore, I believe it is quite an effective way to influence government decisions, though it is not the only method available for civic engagement.\n\nANSWER: A"
