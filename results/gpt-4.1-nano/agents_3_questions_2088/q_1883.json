        "raw_output": "The growing number of older people in the country is often seen as a minor problem. While it presents some challenges to social services and healthcare systems, many countries are also able to adapt through policy changes, healthcare innovations, and social programs. The demographic shift can be managed effectively with proper planning, making it less of a crisis than a manageable issue. Therefore, it is not viewed as a major problem, nor is it generally considered insignificant, but rather a situation that requires attention without being catastrophic.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The growing number of older people in my country is a complex demographic change that can have both positive and negative implications. While an aging population may strain healthcare systems, social services, and pension funds, it also brings experience, wisdom, and stability. The impact largely depends on how effectively policies are implemented to support older adults and integrate them into society. Therefore, I see it as a minor problem, manageable with appropriate planning rather than an overwhelming crisis.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it can strain healthcare and pension systems, it also offers potential benefits such as experienced workforce participation and cultural richness. Overall, whether it is a major or minor problem depends on societal adaptability, but currently, it is more of a minor issue, as many policies are in place to manage aging populations effectively.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there can be benefits such as accumulated experience, the strain on resources and the need for substantial adjustments in policies make it a substantial issue that requires urgent attention.

While it may create pressures on healthcare and pension systems, many countries are already adapting to this demographic shift, making it more of a minor issue than a major crisis if properly addressed.

However, with proper policy reforms, innovations, and social programs, these issues can be managed effectively.

As the population ages, there will likely be increased pressure on healthcare systems, pension schemes, and social support networks.

While some adaptation is possible, the scale of this demographic shift warrants a serious level of concern and planning. Therefore, I consider it a major problem.\n\nANSWER: A",
