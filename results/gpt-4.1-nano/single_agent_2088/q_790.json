  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that many countries have improved their cybersecurity measures, but significant vulnerabilities still exist due to increasing sophistication of cyber threats and the rapid pace of technological change. While governments and organizations are investing more in defense systems, the ever-evolving nature of cyberattacks makes it difficult to feel entirely confident that we are fully prepared for a major incident. Therefore, I think the country is somewhat well prepared, but there is still room for improvement and concern. \n\nANSWER: B"
