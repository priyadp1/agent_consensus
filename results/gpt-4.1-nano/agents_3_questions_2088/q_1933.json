        "raw_output": "I believe that ensuring economic wellbeing in old age should primarily be a shared responsibility, but if I had to choose the most responsible party, I would say it is the individual themselves. Personal financial planning, saving, and responsible consumption are crucial for securing one's future, as relying solely on families or government support can be uncertain or insufficient. While government programs and family support are important safety nets, individuals should actively participate in managing their own financial security to foster independence and resilience in old age.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "I believe that the responsibility for people's economic wellbeing in old age should be shared among multiple parties, but ultimately, individuals must have a significant role in planning and saving for their future. Families can provide emotional and sometimes financial support, but as societies evolve and family structures change, relying solely on families becomes less sustainable. Governments should create comprehensive social safety nets and pension systems to support the elderly, ensuring that no one is left in hardship. However, individuals also need to actively participate in decisions about their long-term financial security. Therefore, a combined approach where everyone shares responsibility seems most effective, but emphasizing personal responsibility encourages proactive planning. \n\nANSWER: D",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe that ensuring economic wellbeing in old age is a shared responsibility that involves personal planning, family support, and government policies. However, the most practical approach is that individuals should take primary responsibility by actively saving and planning for their retirement, complemented by supportive policies from the government and involvement from families when possible. Relying solely on families or the government may not be sufficient due to economic shifts and changing family structures, so an integrated effort is most sustainable. Therefore, I choose personal responsibility as the main focus.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe that while personal responsibility is crucial, relying solely on individuals may leave many vulnerable due to unforeseen circumstances or economic challenges. Families can offer emotional and some financial support, but their capacity varies and may not be sufficient on its own. The government plays a vital role by establishing social safety nets, pension schemes, and policies to ensure that everyone has access to a basic standard of living in old age. Therefore, a balanced shared responsibility among individuals, families, and the government is essential, but the top priority should be on the roles that can systematically provide security for all. \n\nANSWER: D",

Personal initiative promotes independence and resilience, and reliance on external support alone may not always be reliable or sufficient. Therefore, I think individuals should bear the greatest responsibility, supported by family and government policies.\n\nANSWER: C",

While personal financial planning and saving are crucial for independence, support systems provided by the government help protect against unforeseen circumstances and inequality. Families can offer emotional and financial support, but relying solely on them is less sustainable given changing family structures. A balanced, collective approach ensures that no one is left vulnerable and promotes a more equitable safety net for all.

While individuals should certainly take responsibility for their own financial planning to foster independence and resilience, external support from families and the government remains essential to address disparities, provide safety nets, and support those unable to fully plan or save. Relying solely on oneself overlooks the complexities of economic security, but entrusting all responsibility to families or the government could lead to vulnerabilities or inequalities. Therefore, sharing responsibility among individuals, families, and government creates a more balanced and sustainable system.\n\nANSWER: D",

While families and individuals play vital roles, the government\u2019s capacity to implement policies and social programs provides a foundation that helps mitigate vulnerabilities that cannot be consistently addressed by families or personal efforts alone.
