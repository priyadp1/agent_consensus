  "question": "In your opinion, do lower income have too much influence in our political system, not enough influence, or about the right amount?",
  "options": [
    "Too much",
    "Not enough",
    "Right amount"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "In my opinion, lower income individuals tend to have too little influence in our political system. This is because political power is often linked to wealth and access, which can create barriers for those with fewer financial resources to effectively advocate for their interests. Ensuring a more balanced influence would promote a more equitable democracy where everyone's voice counts equally. \n\nANSWER: B"
