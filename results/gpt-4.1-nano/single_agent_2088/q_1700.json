  "raw_output": "The role of Islam in our country's political life varies depending on the context and the level of influence religious beliefs have on political decisions. In many countries with significant Muslim populations, Islam can play a substantial role in shaping policies, societal norms, and political discourse. However, the extent of this influence often fluctuates due to secular governance, legal frameworks, and differing levels of religious engagement among the population. Given this, I believe Islam plays a fairly large role in the political life of our country, as it remains an important aspect for a significant portion of the population and influences various aspects of governance and societal debates.\n\nANSWER: B",
