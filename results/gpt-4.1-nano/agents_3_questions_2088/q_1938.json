        "raw_output": "In my opinion, Islam plays a greater role in politics in this country compared to a few years ago. This increase can be seen as both an opportunity and a challenge. On one hand, greater religious influence can promote moral values and social cohesion among communities that share these beliefs. On the other hand, it might also lead to increased polarization or marginalization of those who hold different views or beliefs. Whether this is good or bad depends on how it affects social harmony, individual rights, and the separation of religion and state. Overall, I think it has the potential to be both beneficial and problematic, but I believe the impact leans more toward the negative side if it undermines democratic principles and inclusivity.\n\nANSWER: B",

If it leads to policies that promote social justice, community cohesion, and ethical governance, it could be beneficial for the country. However, if it results in divisiveness, marginalization of certain groups, or the loss of secular principles, it might be harmful. Ultimately, whether this trend is good or bad depends on how it influences the inclusivity, stability, and fairness of our political system.\n\nANSWER: C",
