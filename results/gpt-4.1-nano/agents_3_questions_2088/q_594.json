        "raw_output": "I believe public transportation is a very important aspect of daily life for many people, especially in urban areas. Good public transportation reduces traffic congestion, pollution, and provides accessibility to those who do not own cars. If public transportation is inadequate or unreliable, it can significantly impact people's daily routines and the overall efficiency of a city. Therefore, I consider it a very big problem if the public transportation system is poor or struggling. \n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Public transportation is a crucial part of everyday life for many people, especially in urban areas. When it functions well, it can greatly reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and commuting times. However, in many parts of the country, public transportation systems face issues such as limited coverage, unreliability, or safety concerns, which can hinder their effectiveness. Depending on the region, perceptions may vary, but overall, public transportation often remains a significant concern for many citizens as it impacts access, mobility, and quality of life. Considering these factors, I believe it is a moderately big problem, as improvements are needed in many places but it may not always be the top-tier most pressing issue compared to others like healthcare or the economy.\n\nANSWER: B",
