        "raw_output": "Religious leaders can have a significant impact on societal values and community cohesion. In many cases, their influence can promote moral guidance, social support, and charitable activities, which are beneficial for societal progress.

Considering these points, I believe that in my country, religious leaders tend to have a somewhat positive influence overall, but their impact is not universally beneficial and sometimes can be problematic.
