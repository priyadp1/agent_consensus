While there may still be challenges, the signs of improvement suggest that our system has the capacity to bounce back and adapt effectively. Therefore, I lean toward the view that the economy is recovering in ways that highlight its strengths rather than failing or being unable to recover. Additionally, I recognize that some problems may require international cooperation, but my primary view pertains to the overall recovery process making the economy seem stronger. \n\nANSWER: A",
