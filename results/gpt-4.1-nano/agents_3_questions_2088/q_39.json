        "raw_output": "The outcome of the upcoming parliamentary elections largely depends on the choices and actions of the elected representatives, as well as the current political and economic climate. If the elections bring in leadership committed to reform, transparency, and addressing key issues, they could positively influence the country's conditions. Conversely, if they result in increased polarization or stagnation, it might worsen the situation. Given these considerations, it is difficult to predict a definitive impact, but optimistic expectations for improvement are common when well-managed elections are held. Therefore, I believe the elections have the potential to improve conditions in our country.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "The outcome of the upcoming parliamentary elections largely depends on the candidates' policies, voter turnout, and overall political climate. If meaningful reforms and constructive debates occur, it could lead to improved conditions. However, if the elections are characterized by polarization or corruption, they might exacerbate existing issues. In general, elections have the potential to bring positive change when they promote accountability and good governance, but they can also deepen divisions or stagnate progress if not conducted effectively. Therefore, I believe the most balanced view is that they will likely have no definitive effect until their actual outcomes are realized.\n\nANSWER: C",

However, there is also significant risk that they could deepen existing divisions or lead to stagnation if polarization or corruption prevail. Given these uncertainties and the possibility of both positive and negative effects, I think the most realistic expectation is that the elections might not have a definitive immediate effect.
