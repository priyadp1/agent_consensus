    "Fairly small role",
    "Very small role"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that religion can play an important role in shaping moral values and guiding ethical behavior, but in a diverse and pluralistic society, it is essential that the political sphere remains inclusive and neutral to ensure equal rights for all citizens regardless of their faith.
