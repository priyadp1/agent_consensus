        "raw_output": "I believe that the fairness of the court system varies depending on the country and individual experiences. In some countries, the courts are perceived as impartial and treat everyone equally, leading to a perception that they do so very well or somewhat well. However, in others, issues such as corruption, bias, or lack of transparency can undermine public confidence, leading many to feel that the system does not treat everyone fairly at all. Given this variability, I think most people would recognize that, while there are places where the system works well, overall, it may not be consistent or fair everywhere. Therefore, I would choose the option reflecting a moderate perception, leaning towards the system not being perceived as entirely fair.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there are mechanisms for justice and some examples of fairness, systemic problems and disparities sometimes undermine the ideal of absolute fairness for all.

While many cases do result in just outcomes and there are legal protections in place, systemic biases, delays, and inequalities still occur, which suggest that fairness is somewhat compromised.
