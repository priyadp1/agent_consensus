In many places, reports of increased crime, social unrest, and violence have been prevalent over the past decade. While some regions may have seen improvements in safety, overall, there is a general perception that safety has decreased due to these wider societal issues and increased awareness through media.

Overall, there has been a mixed trend; however, in many places, safety has generally improved due to increased awareness, technological advancements in law enforcement, and community engagement, leading to a perception or reality of greater safety in some areas.
