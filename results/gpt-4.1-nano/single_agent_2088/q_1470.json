  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that a democratic form of government is better suited to addressing our country's problems because it ensures representation, accountability, and the protection of individual rights. Relying on a strong leader may lead to quick decisions, but it also risks abuse of power and erosion of freedoms. Ensuring that the people have a say in governance promotes fairness and long-term stability, which I see as crucial for our nation's progress.\n\nANSWER: A",
