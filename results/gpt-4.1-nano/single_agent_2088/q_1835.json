  "raw_output": "I am aware that Hassan Rouhani served as Iran's president from 2013 to 2021, known for relatively moderate policies and attempts at diplomacy, especially regarding the Iran nuclear deal. Public opinion about him varies depending on perspectives on Iran's foreign policy, internal politics, and economic conditions. Since the question asks for my personal opinion, which is subjective and based on general knowledge, I would consider that I view him somewhat favorably because of his reputation for seeking diplomatic solutions. Therefore, I would choose B.\n\nANSWER: B",
