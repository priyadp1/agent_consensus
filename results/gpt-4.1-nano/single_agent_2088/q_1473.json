  "raw_output": "Religious leaders can significantly influence societal values, ethical standards, and community cohesion, which can be positive if they promote unity and moral guidance. However, their influence can also be problematic if it fosters division, intolerance, or resists social progress. In many contexts, the impact of religious leaders tends to be mixed, but overall, their influence is often viewed as more beneficial than harmful, especially when they support social harmony. Given these considerations, their influence is generally seen as somewhat good, although opinions may vary. \n\nANSWER: B",
