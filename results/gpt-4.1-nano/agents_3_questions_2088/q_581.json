        "raw_output": "Corrupt political leaders undermine trust in government, distort policy priorities, and often lead to injustice and inequality. Given their significant negative impact on governance and society, many people see corruption at the political level as a serious issue that needs urgent attention. While some may consider it less severe depending on their experiences or context, generally, corruption within leadership is widely regarded as a major problem affecting the fairness and effectiveness of public institutions.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Corrupt political leaders can undermine trust in government, distort resources and priorities, and harm democratic processes. While in some cases corruption may be moderate or localized, widespread corruption typically poses a very significant threat to societal stability, economic development, and governance. Therefore, it is generally considered a very big problem, especially when corruption is systemic and pervasive.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Corrupt political leaders are generally considered a significant problem because they undermine trust in government institutions, distort democratic processes, and can lead to widespread inequality and inefficiency. While some may see it as a very big problem, others might consider it moderately big depending on the context or extent of corruption. Overall, given the potential harm and the importance of integrity in leadership, many would view this as at least a moderately big problem, if not a very big one. However, since the question asks for a subjective opinion, I believe most respondents would see it as a very big problem due to its serious implications for society.\n\nANSWER: A",
