        "raw_output": "I believe that whether abortion is considered moral or not depends on individual circumstances, values, and beliefs. For some, it is a deeply personal moral decision based on their view of autonomy, bodily rights, and ethical considerations. For others, it might be seen as morally unacceptable due to religious or cultural convictions. Since the morality of abortion can vary greatly depending on context and perspective, it seems more accurate to regard it as a complex issue that may or may not be within the realm of morality for different people. Therefore, I lean towards viewing it as dependent on the situation. \n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "I believe that having an abortion can be viewed as morally acceptable depending on individual circumstances, such as a woman's health, autonomy, and the context of the pregnancy. While some may see it as a moral issue, others may consider it a personal decision that involves complex moral considerations rather than a straightforward moral judgment. Therefore, I see it as a nuanced issue that depends heavily on individual situations and beliefs.\n\nANSWER: D",

For some, it may be a moral issue that involves complex considerations about autonomy, rights, and ethics. For others, it may not be a moral issue at all, perhaps viewed as a personal choice without inherent moral weight. Since people's perspectives differ based on diverse values and situations, it is hard to categorize it universally without context. Therefore, I think it depends on the situation.\n\nANSWER: D",

For some, it involves complex ethical considerations related to autonomy, rights, and compassion, making it a moral issue. For others, it might be seen as a personal or private matter that isn't inherently moral, or they might view different situations differently.
