        "raw_output": "I believe the fairness of the upcoming presidential election depends heavily on the electoral processes, transparency, and integrity maintained by authorities. If ongoing issues such as political interference, voter suppression, or lack of independent oversight persist, it raises concerns about the potential for an unfair process. Conversely, if measures are implemented to ensure transparency and safeguard voters' rights, the election could be conducted fairly. Given current reports and debates on electoral integrity, there is reason to be cautious about possible irregularities. Therefore, I lean toward the possibility that the election might be conducted unfairly, especially if significant safeguards are not in place.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there have been efforts to improve election procedures, concerns about voter suppression, misinformation, and potential interference still exist in some areas. Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to be entirely confident that the election will be conducted fairly, but ongoing reforms and vigilance could help ensure a more transparent process. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe the fairness of the next presidential election depends heavily on the political climate and the integrity of the electoral process. If authorities continue to prioritize transparency, implement robust measures to prevent fraud, and ensure equal access for all voters, then it is more likely to be conducted fairly. However, if there are widespread concerns about corruption, voter suppression, or manipulation, it could undermine confidence and lead to an unfair process. Given current global and national political tensions, there is some uncertainty, but efforts are underway in many areas to uphold fairness. Therefore, my outlook is cautiously optimistic but remains subject to developments and ongoing reforms.\n\nANSWER: A",
