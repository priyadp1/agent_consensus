  "question": "Do you think US and British leaders knew Iraq had no weapons, or did they simply choose to believe only the intelligence that supported going to war?",
  "options": [
    "Knew Iraq had no weapons",
    "Chose to believe only the intelligence that supported going"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Based on the available evidence and analyses, it appears that many US and British leaders had access to intelligence reports indicating that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction. However, the decision to proceed with the war suggests that they either disregarded or selectively interpreted this intelligence to justify the invasion. This implies that they may have chosen to believe only the intelligence that supported going to war, rather than being fully convinced of Iraq's possession of weapons. Hence, the more plausible explanation is that they selectively relied on favorable intelligence to support their decision.\n\nANSWER: B",
