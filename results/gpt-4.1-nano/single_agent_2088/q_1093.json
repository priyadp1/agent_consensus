  "raw_output": "Increased trade with China could provide economic benefits such as lower prices for consumers and expanded market opportunities for U.S. businesses. However, it may also lead to concerns about job displacement, intellectual property issues, and trade deficits that could negatively impact certain industries and the overall economy. Balancing these factors, I believe that increased trade can be somewhat good for our country, as it promotes economic growth but requires careful management to mitigate potential negative effects.\n\nANSWER: B",
