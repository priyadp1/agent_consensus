        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that opinions about the PRI can vary widely depending on personal experiences, political perspectives, and recent political developments in Mexico. Given that the PRI has historically been a dominant party but also associated with periods of corruption and authoritarianism, public sentiment might be divided. If I were to choose an option, I would consider that many people may still hold some favorable views due to the party's historical significance or its role in governance, while others may view it unfavorably due to past controversies. Without specific recent data, I lean towards a moderate stance, perhaps presuming that opinions are more subdued rather than polarized. Therefore, I select a middle-ground option. \n\nANSWER: B",

Historically, the PRI has been a dominant political party in Mexico, with a long-standing presence in the country's political landscape. While I recognize that the party has faced criticism and controversy related to corruption and authoritarian tendencies in the past, I also acknowledge its role in stabilizing and shaping Mexico's political development.

Given that other respondents found a moderate stance appropriate and that my own reasoning aligns with a balanced perspective, I will reaffirm a somewhat favorable view.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Considering the historical context and current perceptions, my opinion of the PRI is somewhat mixed. While the party played a significant role in Mexico\u2019s political history and some individuals may still hold favorable views, the widespread associations with corruption and authoritarian practices have led to generally negative sentiments.
