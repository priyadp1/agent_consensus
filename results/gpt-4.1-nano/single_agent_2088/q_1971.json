  "question": "Who do you think is launching these missile strikes, the Pakistani government, the United States government, or someone else?",
  "options": [
    "Pakistani government",
    "U.S. government",
    "Someone else",
    "Both Pakistan and U.S. (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "I believe these missile strikes are not solely attributable to the Pakistani government or the U.S. government, but rather involve multiple actors. There have been instances where regional conflicts and covert operations lead to ambiguity regarding responsibility, which suggests that someone else or both nations could be involved in different capacities. Given this complexity, I select the option that reflects potential involvement from more than one side or other unknown parties.\n\nANSWER: D",
