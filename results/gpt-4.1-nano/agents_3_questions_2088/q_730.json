        "raw_output": "Vladimir Putin is widely perceived as the central figure of power in Russia, having served multiple terms as president and consolidating control over the government and security institutions. Dmitry Medvedev has held significant positions, including president and prime minister, but his influence has generally been seen as subordinate to Putin's dominant leadership. Given the current political landscape, it is likely that Putin will maintain or increase his influence moving forward, whereas Medvedev's role appears to be more of a senior advisor or figure within Putin's administration. Therefore, I believe Putin will have more political power.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Considering their current positions and influence within the Russian political landscape, Vladimir Putin remains the central figure with the most authority and control over policy and governance. Dmitry Medvedev, while still a significant political figure, has generally been in a subordinate role relative to Putin, and his influence does not seem to surpass or even match Putin\u2019s ongoing dominance. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Putin will continue to hold more political power in the foreseeable future.\n\nANSWER: A",

Dmitry Medvedev, while still an influential politician, generally appears to play a more secondary role compared to Putin, especially given Putin's continued control and leadership. Therefore, it is likely that Putin will retain or increase his political power in the foreseeable future.\n\nANSWER: A",

Despite Dmitry Medvedev's significant roles in the government, his influence has generally been seen as subordinate to Putin's ongoing control. The other respondents' assessments confirm Putin's centrality and expectation that he will continue to hold more political power moving forward.

The current political landscape further supports the idea that Putin's influence will likely persist or grow, while Medvedev's role remains secondary.
