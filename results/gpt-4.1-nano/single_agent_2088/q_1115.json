  "question": "Do you think our country should have UN approval before it uses military force to deal with an international threat or do you think that would make it too difficult for our country to deal with international threats?",
  "options": [
    "Should have UN approval",
    "Would make it too difficult to deal with threats"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that requiring UN approval before using military force promotes international cooperation and legitimacy, ensuring that actions are taken with broader consensus and potentially reducing unnecessary conflicts. While it might slow down the response time, these diplomatic processes can lead to more effective and justified interventions in the long run. Quick unilateral actions could lead to unnecessary escalation or backlash, so having a formal approval process helps balance the need for swift action with the importance of global oversight.\n\nANSWER: A",
