        "raw_output": "Depending on the country and its societal norms, opportunities for men and women in leadership within local communities can vary significantly. In many places, traditional gender roles and unequal access to education or resources might lead to men having more opportunities. Conversely, in countries with strong gender equality policies, women may have similar or even greater opportunities to become community leaders. If I consider a context where gender equality has progressed but disparities still exist, I would think men generally have more opportunities in such leadership roles.\n\nANSWER: A",

Society often has traditional expectations and structures that make it easier for men to assume leadership roles, while women may face cultural, social, or institutional barriers that limit their chances. Despite progress, these disparities still persist in many areas, which influences my perception that men generally have more opportunities in this regard.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "In many countries, leadership in local communities often involves social expectations, gender roles, and access to resources that influence opportunities. Historically, men have typically had more avenues for leadership roles and social power, partly due to cultural norms and systemic inequalities. While progress has been made toward gender equality, disparities still exist in many contexts. Therefore, it seems that, in general, men tend to have more opportunities to be leaders in their local communities compared to women. \n\nANSWER: A",
