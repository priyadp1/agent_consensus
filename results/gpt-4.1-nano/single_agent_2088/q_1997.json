  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The territorial disputes between the Philippines and China have significant strategic, economic, and national sovereignty implications, often causing tension and concern within the Philippines. While some may see it as a major issue, others might consider it less immediate depending on the current diplomatic climate or government priorities. Overall, many Filipinos perceive it as a serious concern that impacts their nation's security and regional stability, but it may not be perceived as the absolute biggest problem across all issues facing the country. Therefore, it can be reasonably categorized as a big problem, reflecting its importance but not necessarily its status as the most critical issue overall.\n\nANSWER: B",
