  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that allowing the US and its allies to use bases in Iraq was a complex decision with both potential benefits and serious consequences. On one hand, it could enhance regional security and support international efforts against terrorism. On the other hand, it risked sovereignty issues and internal unrest. Considering the long-term instability and the divergent opinions within Iraq and the broader international community, I think the decision may have overlooked some important regional repercussions. Therefore, I feel it was a wrong decision given the negative consequences that followed. \n\nANSWER: B",
