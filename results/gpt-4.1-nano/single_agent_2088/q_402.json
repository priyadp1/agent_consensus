  "question": "Do you think that the Salvadoran government is making progress in its campaign against urban gangs, losing ground, or are things about the same as they have been in the past? ",
  "options": [
    "Making progress",
    "Losing ground",
    "Same as they have been in the past"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Based on recent reports and observations, the Salvadoran government has implemented several measures to combat urban gangs, with some success in arrests and reduction of violence in certain areas. However, challenges persist as gangs remain active and adaptable, and violence still affects daily life in many parts of the country. Overall, progress seems moderate and inconsistent, indicating that while there are positive signs, the situation has not significantly improved nor worsened across the board. Therefore, it appears that the situation is about the same as it has been in the past.\n\nANSWER: C"
