Question 9
Please tell me how worried you are about each of the following issues related to Muslims living in your country...extremism among Muslims...Are you very worried, somewhat worried, not too worried, or not at all worried about extremism among Muslims?

I would say I am "Somewhat worried" about extremism among Muslims living in my country. While I believe that extremism represents a small minority and that most Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding citizens, I think it's important to remain vigilant and supportive of community efforts aimed at preventing radicalization. My concern is proportionate to the actual threat, and I trust that authorities and communities are working to address such issues effectively.
