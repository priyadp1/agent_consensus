  "raw_output": "I believe Germany should limit its military role due to its historical context and the importance of promoting peace through diplomacy rather than intervention. Given Germany's history in the 20th century, a cautious approach to military involvement helps maintain its commitment to peaceful relations and stability worldwide without risking escalation or misunderstanding. Therefore, I support a limited military role to prioritize peaceful solutions and prevent repeating past conflicts.\n\nANSWER: B",
