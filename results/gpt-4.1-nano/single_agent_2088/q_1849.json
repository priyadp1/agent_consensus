  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that in foreign policy, it is important for the United States to prioritize its own national interests even if that causes disagreement with allies. This approach ensures that the country remains focused on its own security and economic well-being, rather than being overly compelled to compromise or align with allies' perspectives at the expense of its core objectives. While cooperation with allies is valuable, safeguarding national interests should take precedence for long-term stability and sovereignty.\n\nANSWER: B",
