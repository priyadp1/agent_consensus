        "raw_output": "Based on general observations, the attitudes among Muslims in our country are diverse. Many individuals seek to integrate and adopt the broader societal customs to participate fully in national life, while others prioritize maintaining distinct cultural or religious practices that define their identity. It is reasonable to conclude that a significant portion of Muslims may hold a mix of both perspectives, attempting to balance integration with preservation of their traditions. However, since the question asks for a general trend, the most appropriate choice reflects the spectrum of attitudes rather than a singular stance.\n\nANSWER: C",
