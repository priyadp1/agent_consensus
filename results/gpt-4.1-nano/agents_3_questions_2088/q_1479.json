        "raw_output": "I believe the influence of corporations in my country tends to be somewhat bad. While they contribute to the economy and provide jobs, their priorities often focus on profit maximization rather than social welfare or environmental sustainability. This sometimes leads to policies or practices that harm communities, exploit workers, or damage the environment, which I see as having a negative impact on the overall well-being of the country.\n\nANSWER: C",

This leads to increased inequality, environmental damage, and policies that often favor corporate interests over the public good. Consequently, their impact tends to hinder overall societal progress rather than promote it.\n\nANSWER: C",
