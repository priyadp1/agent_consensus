        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that addressing global climate change will require significant lifestyle changes by individuals and societies, such as reducing carbon footprints, shifting to renewable energy sources, and adopting more sustainable practices. While technological advancements can help mitigate the problem, they are unlikely to fully solve it without complementary behavioral changes. Major efforts in both areas are essential for meaningful progress.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I believe that addressing global climate change will require significant changes in how people live, such as reducing reliance on fossil fuels, changing consumption habits, and adopting more sustainable practices. While technological advancements can help mitigate some impacts and improve efficiency, they are unlikely to fully solve the problem without major behavioral and lifestyle changes from society. Therefore, I think both individual and collective efforts are necessary, and major lifestyle adjustments cannot be entirely avoided if we want to effectively combat climate change.\n\nANSWER: A",
