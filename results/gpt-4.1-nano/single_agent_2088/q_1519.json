    "Men generally have more opportunities",
    "Women generally have more opportunities",
    "Opportunities are generally about the same for both",

  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "In many countries, societal norms and institutional factors can influence the level of opportunity men and women have to express their political views. While progress has been made toward gender equality, disparities still exist in certain contexts, such as in restrictive environments or where cultural expectations discourage women from openly sharing their views. Conversely, in more open and democratic societies, opportunities may be more equal, but perceptions of inequality can still persist. Given this variability, I believe that, on the whole, women may still face more barriers when it comes to freely expressing their political views than men do, but this is not true everywhere. Therefore, I think that women generally have more opportunities is less accurate, and men generally have more opportunities may be closer to reality in some contexts. However, without specific context, the most balanced option reflecting perceptions of equality or disparity is \"about the same.\"\n\nANSWER: C",
