  "question": "I am going to read you the same list.  Does...the media can report the news without (state or government) censorship...describe our country very well, somewhat well, not too well or not well at all?",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the media reports the news quite well because, in many cases, it operates with a level of independence and strives to provide accurate information. However, there are occasional issues with censorship or influence from political or corporate interests, which can impact objectivity. Consequently, while it does a good job overall, it may not fully capture the complexity of the situation. Therefore, I think it describes our country somewhat well.\n\nANSWER: B"
