Some perceive his leadership as stabilizing and beneficial for regional development, which could be seen as somewhat good. Others might criticize his policies or governance style, suggesting that his influence is somewhat bad. Overall, considering the mixed opinions and the ongoing political tensions, his influence does not appear entirely positive but also not entirely destructive.
