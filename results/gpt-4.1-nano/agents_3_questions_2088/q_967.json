        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "My impression is that foreign companies operating in our country's oil and petrol industry tend to prioritize profits over environmental concerns. Their activities often lead to inadequate safety measures and environmental degradation. While some may argue that regulations might limit their impact, the widespread perception is that these companies contribute significantly to environmental harm. Therefore, I would consider that they ruin the environment to a substantial extent.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The perception of foreign companies in the oil and petrol industry damaging the environment can vary among individuals, often depending on their awareness of the companies' practices and the environmental impact they perceive. If the general sentiment leans toward the belief that these companies significantly harm the environment, then \"Very well\" would be appropriate. If people think the impact is not as severe, then \"Somewhat well\" or \"Not too well\" might be better. Given the common concerns about environmental degradation associated with foreign oil companies in many countries, I believe many people see their impact as quite harmful, but not everyone might hold the strongest view. Therefore, I think they somewhat describe the situation.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that foreign companies in the oil and petrol industry in our country tend to prioritize profit over environmental concerns, often leading to significant environmental degradation. Reports and local perceptions suggest that the emphasis on resource extraction and operational practices sometimes result in pollution and environmental harm. While some companies may adhere to regulations, overall, their activities appear to have a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, I think they can be characterized as ruining the environment to a considerable extent.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Considering the varying perspectives, some respondents believe that foreign oil companies significantly harm the environment, aligning with the choice of \"Very well,\" while others perceive the impact as less severe, suggesting \"Somewhat well.\" The overall perception seems to acknowledge a notable negative environmental impact, but not necessarily to the fullest extent. Given this, I think describing the situation as \"Somewhat well\" best captures the general sentiment, acknowledging concerns without overstating the level of destruction.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that foreign companies operating in our country's oil and petrol industry significantly contribute to environmental degradation. Based on reports, local perceptions, and observed practices, their focus on profit often results in inadequate safety and environmental measures, leading to pollution and harm to natural resources. While some companies may follow regulations, the overall impact appears to be damaging to the environment.

        "raw_output": "Based on the information provided by other respondents, there is a perception that foreign companies in the oil and petrol industry significantly harm the environment, but opinions vary from somewhat to very well describing the extent of damage. Given that the question asks specifically about the perception of the extent to which these companies ruin the environment, and most respondents seem to agree that their impact is considerable but not universally seen as the worst, I believe the best fit is \"Somewhat well\" to reflect a moderate to high perception of harm, recognizing that views differ but generally align with notable environmental damage.\n\nANSWER: B",

Their profit-driven motives often lead to inadequate safety and environmental safeguards, resulting in pollution and natural resource harm.

Since the question is about how well the statement \"They ruin the environment\" describes these companies, and most perceive a notable but not absolute level of damage, \"Somewhat well\" seems to best reflect the moderate to considerable but not total perceived harm.
