While some media outlets strive to provide unbiased and comprehensive reporting, others might be influenced by political or economic interests, affecting how well they reflect the true state of affairs.

        "raw_output": "I believe that the media's ability to report news without government censorship is crucial for understanding how well a country adheres to principles of free press and transparency. While in some countries the media operates relatively independently, in others, censorship or government influence can significantly distort the information available to the public. Therefore, this question gauges the extent to which the media can freely and accurately report the news, which is an important indicator of the country's openness and democratic health. Considering this, I would choose the option that reflects a moderate to strong level of independence, acknowledging both the ideal and the reality.\n\nANSWER: B",
