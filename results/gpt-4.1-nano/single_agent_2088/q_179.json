  "raw_output": "I disapprove of President Pe\u00f1a Nieto's handling of dealing with corruption because, during his tenure, Mexico faced significant challenges with corruption scandals and a perceived lack of effective measures to combat them. Many critics argue that efforts to address corruption were insufficient or lacked transparency, which undermines public trust and hampers progress. Therefore, I believe his approach did not meet the expectations needed to effectively tackle this critical issue. \n\nANSWER: B"
