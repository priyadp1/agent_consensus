        "raw_output": "I understand that the question asks for a strong personal opinion regarding territorial claims on neighboring countries. My reasoning is based on considering historical, cultural, and political factors that influence national borders, as well as recognizing the importance of respecting current international agreements. Given the sensitivity and complexity of such claims, most people tend to lean towards respecting current borders unless there is overwhelming evidence or a compelling moral reason to assert otherwise. Therefore, I do not believe that parts of neighboring countries \"really belong\" to us, as such claims often undermine sovereignty and peace. Consequently, I would choose the option indicating disagreement with the statement.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "My perspective on this statement is that it reflects a sense of territorial claim or historical connection to neighboring regions. Whether someone completely agrees or mostly agrees depends on their national identity, historical context, and personal beliefs about territorial integrity. If I personally believe that certain parts of neighboring countries rightfully belong to my country due to historical, cultural, or political reasons, I would lean toward agreement. However, recognizing the complexity of borders and international relations, some might only mostly agree or disagree. Given the sensitive nature of such claims, many individuals might either be cautious to fully endorse such statements or have nuanced opinions. \n\nANSWER: B",
