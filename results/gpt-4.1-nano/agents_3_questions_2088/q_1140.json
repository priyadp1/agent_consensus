        "raw_output": "In many societies, conflicts between people practicing different religions tend to vary depending on cultural, political, and historical contexts. In some regions, these conflicts are very prominent and have led to violence or discrimination, indicating they are very strong or strong. In other areas, there may be coexistence and tolerance, resulting in weaker or no conflicts. Based on general global trends, conflicts between people of different religions often tend to be noticeable but not universally intense; many societies manage to maintain peaceful coexistence. Therefore, I believe these conflicts are most often not very strong, reflecting some level of disagreement or tension but not outright hostility or violence in most contexts.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "From my perspective, conflicts between people who practice different religions tend to vary depending on the country and context. In some societies, religious differences can lead to very intense conflicts with violent episodes or social tensions, while in others, these differences are more peacefully coexistive, with minor or no conflicts at all. Overall, I believe that in many places, these conflicts are generally not very strong or are minimal, though certain regions or incidents may experience more significant tensions. Therefore, I would describe the general situation as not very strong conflicts, acknowledging that experiences can differ based on location and specific circumstances.\n\nANSWER: C",

In some places, tensions and disagreements can be very strong, often fueled by historical disputes, social prejudices, or political differences. In other areas, coexistence is peaceful, and conflicts are minimal or non-existent. Overall, I believe that in many parts of the world, such conflicts are often perceived as strong or very strong, especially where religious differences are politicized or deeply rooted. However, in some societies, coexistence is more harmonious, leading to fewer conflicts or none at all. Therefore, on average, I think the conflicts are generally perceived as strong or very strong by the public. \n\nANSWER: B",

While in some places these conflicts can be very intense, involving violence or deep-seated tensions, in others, different religions coexist peacefully with minimal or no conflicts. Overall, I believe the dominant perception among the public is that these conflicts are not very strong, reflecting more peaceful coexistence and minor disagreements in many contexts.

While in some regions they are very prominent and lead to violence or discrimination, in others they coexist peacefully with minimal tension. Overall, many societies manage to maintain peaceful relations, and conflicts\u2014if they exist\u2014are often not very strong. This aligns with the view that, in general, such conflicts tend to be not very strong or moderate rather than very intense across the broad spectrum of public opinion worldwide.
