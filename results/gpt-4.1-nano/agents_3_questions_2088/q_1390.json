        "raw_output": "Over the past decade, the role of the United States in the Middle East has evolved due to various geopolitical shifts. In recent years, the US has reduced its direct military presence in some countries and shifted focus towards diplomacy, economic influence, and counterterrorism efforts rather than large-scale interventions. While the US still holds significant influence in shaping regional policies and security arrangements, other actors such as regional powers, China, and Russia have gained prominence. Therefore, I believe the United States now plays a less important role in the Middle East compared to 10 years ago, when it had a more dominant military and political presence following the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Over the past decade, the role of the United States in the Middle East has fluctuated due to changing political dynamics, shifting alliances, and regional conflicts. While the US has historically played a dominant and influential role in regional security, diplomacy, and economic matters, its influence has somewhat declined amid rising regional powers, the emergence of alternative alliances, and a push for greater regional self-reliance. Thus, I believe that the United States plays a less important role in the Middle East today compared with 10 years ago.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "In my opinion, the role of the United States in the Middle East today is about as important as it was 10 years ago. While there may have been fluctuations in influence due to regional conflicts, shifting alliances, and changing policies, the U.S. continues to be a major player in security, economic, and diplomatic affairs in the region. Its military presence, diplomatic initiatives, and economic relationships maintain a consistent level of importance, making its role roughly comparable to that a decade ago. Therefore, I believe its importance has remained stable over the past ten years.\n\nANSWER: C",

While the US continues to have influence, regional powers have grown more assertive, and alternative alliances and initiatives aimed at reducing reliance on the US have gained prominence.

While it remains influential, other actors like regional powers, China, and Russia have increased their presence and impact. These changes suggest that the US's role is somewhat diminished compared to a decade ago, when its military interventions were more prominent.

        "raw_output": "I believe that the role of the United States in the Middle East today is less important than it was 10 years ago. This is because regional powers like Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia have become more assertive and influential, shaping the geopolitical landscape more directly. Additionally, other global powers such as China and Russia have increased their presence and impact in the region, diluting U.S. dominance. These shifts suggest a relative decline in U.S. influence compared to a decade ago, when its military interventions and diplomatic efforts were more pronounced.
