  "question": "When it comes to Germany\u2019s decision-making in the European Union, do you think Germany has too much influence, has too little influence or has about the right amount of influence?",
  "options": [
    "Has too much influence",
    "Has too little influence",

    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Germany is one of the leading and most influential members of the European Union, often shaping policies and decisions significantly. Some may argue that this gives Germany too much influence, potentially overshadowing smaller member states and leading to an imbalance within the Union. Others believe that Germany's influence is justified given its economic strength and role in the EU's stability. Considering the debate around power dynamics within the EU, I think Germany currently has about the right amount of influence to balance its responsibilities and contributions.\n\nANSWER: C"
