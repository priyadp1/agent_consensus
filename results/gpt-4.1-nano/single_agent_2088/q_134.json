  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "My personal stance on immigration policies involves a nuanced perspective that considers both the importance of immigration and the need for effective immigration enforcement. Given this, I might lean toward opposing deportation policies if I believe they could harm individuals or families who have established lives here, or if there are pathways to legal status that can be improved. On the other hand, I also understand concerns about illegal immigration and the importance of upholding immigration laws. Balancing these considerations, I may choose to oppose deporting immigrants currently in the country illegally, especially if there are alternatives like pathways to legalization or reform that can address the issue humanely and fairly. \n\nANSWER: B"
