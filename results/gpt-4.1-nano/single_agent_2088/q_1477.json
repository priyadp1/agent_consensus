  "question": "Regarding the role of religion in government in our country, which do you think is the better model for Egypt - to become a society more like Turkey today or more like Saudi Arabia today?",
  "options": [
    "Turkey",
    "Saudi Arabia",
    "Neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that Egypt could benefit from a model similar to Turkey's, where there is a clear separation of religion and state, allowing for greater religious diversity and personal freedoms. This approach promotes a more inclusive society that respects various beliefs and reduces the influence of religion on government policies. Adopting a more secular framework like Turkey's could help foster social cohesion, protect minority rights, and support democratic development. While respecting cultural traditions, it is important for Egypt to ensure that religion complements governance without dominating it.\n\nANSWER: A",
