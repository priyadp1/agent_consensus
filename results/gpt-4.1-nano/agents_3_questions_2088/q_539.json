        "raw_output": "The influence of the current government in Simferopol on the situation in Crimea can be viewed as somewhat positive, primarily because their policies might have brought some stability and order to the region, especially given the complex political context. However, concerns about resistance to broader reforms and ongoing geopolitical tensions suggest that the influence is not entirely beneficial. Therefore, it seems to fall into the somewhat good category, as it may have improved local governance but still faces significant challenges. \n\nANSWER: B",

While some may see benefits in stability or certain policies, there are concerns about limited progress, lack of political freedoms, or economic challenges that might be associated with governance under the current regime.

While some believe that the government has contributed to stability and development, others criticize it for perceived authoritarianism and lack of broader democratic representation. Overall, the impact appears to be somewhat mixed, with certain positive aspects but also significant concerns that suggest the influence leans toward the somewhat bad side.
