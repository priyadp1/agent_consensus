  "question": "Which statement best describes your views about the future of the European Union, even if none is exactly right?",
  "options": [
    "National governments should transfer more powers to the European Union",
    "The current divison of powers between national governments and the EU should remain the same",
    "Some powers should be returned to national governments",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that some powers should be returned to national governments to better address local needs and preserve sovereignty, especially since the EU's influence can sometimes hinder the ability of individual nations to manage their own affairs effectively. While the EU plays a vital role in cooperation, a balanced distribution of powers that respects national autonomy is crucial for the future stability and acceptance of the union. Therefore, I prefer a model where sovereignty remains with national governments to a certain extent. \n\nANSWER: C",
