Violence not only causes immediate harm but also fosters fear and instability, which can have long-lasting negative impacts on society. While other concerns like restrictions on personal freedoms, division, and economic consequences are important, the immediate threat posed by violence is the most pressing issue because it directly endangers lives and erodes the sense of security necessary for a stable society. Preventing violence is essential to addressing all other potential negative outcomes.\n\nANSWER: A",
