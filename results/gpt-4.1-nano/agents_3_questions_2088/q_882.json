        "raw_output": "My assessment of President Vladimir Putin's handling of corruption is complex. While some might argue that he has taken certain steps to reduce corruption within the government, there are also significant ongoing concerns about the persistence of corrupt practices and lack of transparency at high levels. Given these mixed signals and the perception among some segments of the population that corruption remains a serious obstacle, I am inclined to disapprove, though not entirely dismiss his efforts. Therefore, I choose disapprove.\n\nANSWER: B",

While some measures have been taken, many perceive that significant problems remain, and the effectiveness of anti-corruption initiatives is debated.

        "raw_output": "My view on President Vladimir Putin's handling of corruption is that it has been somewhat problematic. While he has sometimes taken steps to address corruption, there have also been numerous reports and perceptions suggesting that corruption remains widespread within certain sectors of the government and society. His approach has been viewed both as an effort to curb corruption and, in some opinions, as a means to consolidate power, which complicates the overall assessment. Therefore, I disapprove of his handling of corruption.\nANSWER: B",
