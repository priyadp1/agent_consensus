  "question": "I'm going to read a list of some changes that have taken place. Please tell me if you think each one has been a change for the better, a change for the worse, or hasn't it made much of a difference: fast food or convenience food?",
  "options": [
    "Change for the better",
    "Change for the worse",
    "Not much difference"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that fast food and convenience food have generally been a change for the worse because they often contribute to unhealthy eating habits, higher levels of processed ingredients, and can lead to serious health problems over time. While they offer convenience and time-saving benefits, the negative health impacts outweigh these advantages for most people. Therefore, I see this as a decline in overall well-being and health standards.\n\nANSWER: B"
