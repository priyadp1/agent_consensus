  "question": "Do you approve or disapprove of tougher international economic sanctions on Iran to try to stop it from developing nuclear weapons?",
  "options": [
    "Approve",
    "Disapprove"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that tougher international economic sanctions can be an effective non-military way to pressure Iran to halt its nuclear program. Sanctions can limit Iran's access to resources and international trade, encouraging compliance without escalating conflict. However, it's also important to ensure that sanctions are carefully targeted to avoid undue hardship on ordinary citizens. Overall, I support increased sanctions as a means to promote diplomatic solutions and prevent nuclear proliferation.\n\nANSWER: A",
