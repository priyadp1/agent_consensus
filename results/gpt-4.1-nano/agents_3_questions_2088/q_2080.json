        "raw_output": "My perceptions of corruption have increased somewhat due to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, as I observed how some government agencies and officials handled relief efforts, which sometimes appeared inefficient or influenced by personal gain. This experience highlighted issues of misallocation and lack of transparency, leading me to view corruption as more prevalent than I previously thought. However, my perception hasn't dramatically changed; it's a moderate shift based on specific events rather than a complete overhaul of my views. Therefore, I would select that my perception of corruption has changed fairly from this experience.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "My perceptions of corruption have become more severe as I observed how resources were allocated and managed during and after Hurricane Maria. The prolonged recovery process and reports of mismanagement made me more skeptical about the integrity of officials and institutions involved. This experience highlighted the extent to which corruption can impact disaster recovery efforts, leading to a significant increase in my awareness and concern. Therefore, I would say my perceptions have changed a lot.\n\nANSWER: A",

This situation highlighted the extent of systemic issues, leading me to perceive an increase in corruption.
