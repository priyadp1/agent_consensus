Military rule often concentrates power in the hands of a few, suppresses political freedoms and civil liberties, and can lead to repression or violence. Historic examples suggest that military regimes typically lack the democratic accountability necessary for addressing citizens' needs and maintaining stability in the long term. Therefore, I think this approach is not suitable for good governance.\n\nANSWER: D",
