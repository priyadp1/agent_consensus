  "options": [
    "Top priority",
    "Important but lower priority",
    "Not too important",
    "Should not be done",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "My perspective is that ensuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stays in power should not be a priority for Russia's military actions in Syria, as this could prolong conflict and undermine efforts for stability and human rights. Prioritizing Assad's stay may also legitimize a regime accused of widespread abuses, which I believe is not in the broader interest of peace and security. Therefore, I think this should not be a focus of intervention.\n\nANSWER: D"
