  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Supporting NATO sending arms to Ukraine can be justified as an effort to bolster Ukraine's defense and promote stability in the region, potentially deterring further aggression by Russia. However, opposing it might stem from concerns about escalating conflict or unintended consequences that could lead to a broader war. Given the importance of supporting Ukraine's sovereignty while considering the risks of escalation, I lean towards supporting this action as a means to help Ukraine defend itself and uphold international norms.\n\nANSWER: A",
