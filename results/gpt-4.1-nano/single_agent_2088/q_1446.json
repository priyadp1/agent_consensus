  "question": "Do you think it would be a good thing or a bad thing if the next president of Venezuela continued the policies of former President Hugo Chavez?",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad",
    "Neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Continuing the policies of former President Hugo Chavez could have mixed implications. On one hand, Chavez's policies focused on social programs, poverty alleviation, and national sovereignty, which some view positively. On the other hand, his government faced criticism for economic mismanagement, corruption, and erosion of democratic institutions. Therefore, whether it is considered good or bad depends on individual perspectives regarding these complex issues. I believe that maintaining the current policies might perpetuate existing challenges and benefits, making it a nuanced subject. Given this, I lean toward the view that it might be more problematic than beneficial to continue those policies without significant reform. \n\nANSWER: B",
