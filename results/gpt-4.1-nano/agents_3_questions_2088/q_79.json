Maintaining arms treaties promotes global stability and diplomatic relations, and unilateral withdrawals may increase the risk of an arms race rather than enhance security.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Developing a missile defense system despite potential withdrawal from the ABM treaty can be seen as a strategic move to bolster national security and protect against missile threats, especially in the post-9/11 context. However, it may also provoke concerns about arms races and international stability. Given these considerations, individuals might have mixed opinions, but generally, supporting efforts to improve defense capabilities during that period suggests approval.\n\nANSWER: A",

This approach risks undermining longstanding international arms control agreements, which are crucial for global stability and diplomatic trust. While national security is important, the potential escalation of an arms race and deterioration of international relations suggest that maintaining existing treaties would be a more cautious and responsible strategy.
