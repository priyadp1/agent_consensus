Supporting Croatia's continued integration helps strengthen economic, political, and regional stability in Southeast Europe.

Supporting Croatia\u2019s continued integration aligns with the EU\u2019s expansion policy and regional stability goals.

Since it is already part of the EU, the question of admitting it in the next ten years is somewhat redundant; however, support for its ongoing membership and potential further integration aligns with EU policies.
