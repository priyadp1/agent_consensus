  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "Balancing the need for national sovereignty with the benefits of economic cooperation is complex, but in my view, maintaining a strong economic relationship with China is more important. Economic ties can promote stability, mutual growth, and influence, which may also provide leverage in territorial disputes. Being overly tough could jeopardize economic interests and long-term engagement. Therefore, fostering a constructive economic partnership seems to be the more pragmatic approach to managing relations with China.\n\nANSWER: D"
