Additionally, the EU's role in managing regional crises and its stance on global issues have made it a key player on the international stage, perhaps even more so than a decade ago. However, some might argue its influence has diminished due to internal challenges like Brexit and economic difficulties. On balance, I believe its overall significance has grown, reflecting its strengthened role in shaping international policy and cooperation.\n\nANSWER: A",
