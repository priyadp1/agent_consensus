        "raw_output": "The spread of American ideas and customs can be seen as benefiting both sides in different ways. American people may gain economic advantages, cultural influence, and global prominence, which can strengthen national identity and provide soft power benefits. On the other hand, people in other parts of the world often gain access to innovative technologies, entertainment, educational resources, and ideals of democracy and freedom, which can improve quality of life and inspire social change. Given this mutual exchange, the benefits are intertwined, but the question asks who benefits most, and at a broader level, the primary advantage tends to go to the American people through soft power, economic gains, and cultural reach.\n\nANSWER: A",

Americans often gain economic advantages, cultural influence, and diplomatic clout, while people elsewhere may enjoy access to new technologies, entertainment, and ways of thinking that can improve their lives. However, some argue that the primary beneficiaries are the American people, as they reap financial and cultural rewards directly, whereas others see this as a form of cultural exchange that benefits many globally. Given the complexity, choosing the group that benefits most depends on perspective; but overall, the American people tend to benefit primarily from the global dissemination of their ideas and customs.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "The spread of American ideas and customs can benefit both Americans and people in other parts of the world in different ways. Americans may gain economically, culturally, and diplomatically from the global influence, expanding markets, and cultural recognition. At the same time, people in other regions can benefit from access to new technologies, entertainment, and values that promote innovation and diversity. Ultimately, since the question asks who benefits most, it can be argued that Americans tend to benefit more because the global dissemination often enhances their economic and cultural dominance, which in turn can lead to increased advantages for their society. However, recognizing that the benefits are mutual, the primary gain for Americans often appears greater, especially from a geopolitical and economic perspective.\n\nANSWER: A",
