    "Statement 2",
    "Neither/Both equally (VOL)",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that refugees do not necessarily increase the likelihood of terrorism in our country, as most refugees are fleeing violence and seek safety. While concerns about security are valid, evidence does not conclusively link refugee populations to higher terrorism risks. Therefore, my view aligns more with the idea that refugees will not increase the likelihood of terrorism. \n\nANSWER: B",
