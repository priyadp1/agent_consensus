        "raw_output": "I believe the safety of products made in China varies depending on the specific manufacturer, product type, and regulatory enforcement. While some Chinese products meet high safety standards, others may not, due to differences in quality control. Therefore, it is not fair to generalize all Chinese products as less safe; safety can depend on many factors. Hence, I think it depends.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "My view is that the safety of products made in China compared to those made elsewhere can vary depending on the specific product and manufacturer. Many Chinese companies produce high-quality, safe products that meet international standards, while some may fall short due to lapses in quality control. Therefore, making a blanket statement about safety can be misleading, and it's more reasonable to consider each product individually, looking at certifications, reviews, and brand reputation. \n\nANSWER: C",

While many Chinese products meet high safety standards comparable to those from other countries, there are cases where safety might be less assured due to lapses in quality assurance.
