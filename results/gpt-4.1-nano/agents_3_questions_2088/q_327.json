        "raw_output": "Increasing tariffs or fees on imported goods can protect domestic industries from foreign competition, potentially boosting local employment and manufacturing. However, it can also lead to higher prices for consumers, potential trade wars, and retaliation from other countries, which might hurt the economy overall. My view depends on balancing these effects; generally, I might lean toward disapproval if I believe the negative consequences outweigh the benefits, but support if I see it as a strategic move to strengthen the economy. Given the complexity, I tend to disapprove because such measures can harm global trade relations and lead to higher costs for everyday consumers.\n\nANSWER: B",
