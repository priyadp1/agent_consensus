However, critics argue that corruption in the Philippines remains a significant issue, with some perceiving that endemic corruption persists within certain institutions and that measures taken have not entirely eradicated the problem. Given the mixed assessments, my view is that his handling of corruption has been somewhat effective but insufficient to fully curb the issue.\n\nANSWER: B",
