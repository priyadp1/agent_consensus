  "question": "Does this statement describe your country very well, somewhat well, not too well, or not well at all? e. No matter who wins an election, things do not change very much",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all",

  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The statement suggests a perception that political changes do not significantly alter the course of the country regardless of election outcomes. This view may reflect a feeling of political stagnation or dissatisfaction with how leadership changes impact policies and daily life. Depending on the country in question, many citizens might feel that elections do not bring about meaningful change, especially if they perceive a disconnect between electoral outcomes and tangible improvements. Therefore, I believe this statement describes many countries fairly well, though not necessarily perfectly. \n\nANSWER: B",
