  "question": "I'm going to read you a list of things the US might do to combat extremist groups in Pakistan. Please tell me whether you would support or oppose...providing financial and humanitarian aid to areas where extremist groups operate.",
  "options": [
    "Support",
    "Oppose"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Providing financial and humanitarian aid to areas where extremist groups operate is a complex issue. Supporters might argue that aid can address underlying issues such as poverty and lack of education, which can reduce the appeal of extremist ideologies. Opponents might believe that aiding these areas could inadvertently strengthen groups linked to extremism or that resources could be better used elsewhere. Considering both perspectives, I believe that carefully targeted aid, with strict oversight and conditions tied to counter-terrorism efforts, can help stabilize communities and prevent extremism from taking root. Therefore, I support this approach.\n\nANSWER: A"
