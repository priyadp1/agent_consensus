  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The fairness of the court system varies in my country, with some individuals feeling they are treated equally and others experiencing disparities due to factors like socioeconomic status, race, or local jurisdiction differences. While there are efforts to ensure justice and fairness, systemic issues and occasional high-profile cases suggest that the treatment is not consistently fair for everyone. Therefore, I would say the statement describes my country somewhat well, recognizing both efforts and shortcomings in fairness.\n\nANSWER: B",
