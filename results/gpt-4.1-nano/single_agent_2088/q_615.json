  "question": "In your opinion, do United States policies increase the gap between rich and poor countries, lessen the gap between rich and poor countries, or do United States policies have no effect on the gap between rich and poor countries?",
  "options": [
    "Increase gap between rich and poor",
    "Lessen gap between rich and poor",
    "No effect"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe United States policies tend to increase the gap between rich and poor countries. This is because many policies, such as trade agreements, tariffs, and intellectual property rights, often favor developed nations, making it harder for poorer countries to develop and compete on equal footing. Additionally, economic aid and investment strategies may sometimes reinforce dependency rather than promote equitable growth, leading to a widening disparity. Therefore, I think these policies contribute to increasing the gap rather than reducing it or having no effect.\n\nANSWER: A"
