        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe that relations between the public and the U.S. will stay about the same, as many underlying social and political issues tend to persist over short periods, and significant shifts usually require major events or policy changes which are unpredictable in the near future. Given current tensions and divisions, it seems unlikely that relations will improve significantly or deteriorate drastically in the coming years. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe relations between the public and the U.S. are likely to get worse over the next few years due to increasing political polarization, economic challenges, and ongoing international conflicts. These factors tend to strain public perception and trust, making improved relations less probable unless significant efforts are made to address these issues.\n\nANSWER: B",

While efforts in diplomacy and communication might stabilize the situation temporarily, it appears that these factors may contribute to a decline in the overall state of relations.

While there may be challenges, efforts in diplomacy and communication could help prevent significant deterioration, and substantial improvements seem uncertain without major positive developments. Thus, I believe that relations will stay about the same.\n\nANSWER: C",
