While some may wish to maintain their own cultural identity, I think the tendency is toward assimilation rather than separation.

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that most immigrants today tend to want to retain their cultural identities and may not fully adopt all aspects of the prevailing nationality customs and way of life. Therefore, I align more with the idea that they want to be distinct from the society of their new country. This perspective reflects the perception that cultural differences and individual identities are often maintained even after immigration. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Based on the perspectives shared by the other respondents, both tend to believe that many immigrants prefer to maintain their cultural identities and are less inclined to fully adopt the customs and way of life of the host society. They perceive a desire among immigrants to be distinct and retain their own traditions rather than fully assimilate. My own view aligns with this understanding, as I also believe that immigrants often wish to preserve their cultural uniqueness and are less likely to adopt all aspects of the dominant society\u2019s customs, even if some integration occurs. Therefore, I choose the second statement as it best reflects my perspective.\n\nANSWER: B",

The second agent emphasizes maintaining cultural identity and distinct customs, which aligns with the second statement. Since I personally believe that many immigrants do desire to adopt the host country's customs and integrate into society, I align more with the first statement.\n\nANSWER: A",

My own view is that while some degree of cultural retention is natural, the predominant tendency among immigrants is to want to integrate and adopt the society's way of life in order to belong and participate fully.
