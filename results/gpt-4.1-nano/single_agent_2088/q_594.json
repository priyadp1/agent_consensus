  "question": "Now I am going to read you a list of things that may be problems in our country. As I read each one, please tell me if you think it is a very big problem, a moderately big problem, a small problem or not a problem at all...Public transportation",
  "options": [
    "Very big problem",
    "Moderately big problem",
    "Small problem",
    "Not a problem at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe public transportation is an important issue because it affects many people's daily commute, access to services, and overall mobility within the country. If public transportation is unreliable, unsafe, or underfunded, it can cause significant inconvenience and social inequalities. However, in some areas, it may not be perceived as the top problem compared to other issues like healthcare or economy. Overall, I would consider it a moderately big problem because improving public transit could positively impact many aspects of society.\n\nANSWER: B"
