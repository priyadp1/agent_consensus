  "question": "Which one of these poses the second greatest threat to the world?",
  "options": [
    "AIDS and other infectious diseases",
    "Spread of nuclear weapons",
    "Pollution and other environmental problems",
    "Growing gap between the rich and poor"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "While all four issues pose significant threats to the world, the spread of nuclear weapons (B) remains the second greatest because it has the potential for immediate, large-scale destruction if a conflict or accidental launch occurs. Unlike environmental problems or social inequalities, nuclear warfare could cause mass casualties and long-term global consequences almost instantaneously, making it a highly critical concern. However, it is somewhat ranked below the overarching risk of infectious diseases due to their unpredictable yet ongoing threat, and above the social and environmental issues which tend to develop over a longer period. \n\nANSWER: B"
