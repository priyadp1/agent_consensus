  "question": "How much interest do you think the United States is now taking in what goes on in Latin America? Would you say it is taking a great deal of interest, a fair amount of interest, not too much interest, or is it taking no interest at all?",
  "options": [
    "Great deal",
    "Fair amount",
    "Not too much",
    "Not at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the United States is taking a fair amount of interest in what goes on in Latin America. While there is some engagement, it does not seem to be at the highest level of prioritization, especially compared to domestic issues or other international concerns. This moderate attention likely reflects ongoing diplomatic and economic interests, but not an intense or fully prioritized focus. \n\nANSWER: B"
