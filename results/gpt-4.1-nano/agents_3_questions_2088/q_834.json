        "raw_output": "The territorial disputes between China and India have long been a source of tension, leading to military standoffs and strained diplomatic relations. Given the potential for escalation and regional instability, many people might view this issue as quite serious. At the same time, it might not be perceived as an immediate threat to the average person's daily life compared to other pressing issues like economic instability or health crises. Therefore, I consider it somewhat serious but not among the most urgent problems facing society today.\n\nANSWER: B",
