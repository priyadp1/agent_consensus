When these conflicts are intense or persistent, they can lead to violence, displacement, and deepen social divisions. Even when less severe, underlying ethnic tensions can undermine progress and cohesion. Therefore, I believe it is at least a moderately significant problem and possibly a very big one, depending on the context. Given the importance of social harmony, I would assess it as a very big problem in general.\n\nANSWER: A",

In countries where ethnic tensions are high or unresolved, such conflicts can escalate into violence, disrupt everyday life, and hamper development efforts. While some countries manage to maintain relatively peaceful coexistence among different groups, in many others, ethnic conflict remains a substantial issue requiring ongoing attention and effort to resolve.
