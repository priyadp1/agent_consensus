        "raw_output": "European companies building factories in our country can have both positive and negative effects, depending on various factors. On the positive side, they can create jobs, bring investments, improve technology transfer, and boost local industries. These benefits can stimulate economic growth and development. However, there are also concerns about potential negative impacts, such as crowding out local businesses, repatriation of profits to foreign countries, possible environmental degradation, and undermining local industries if the foreign companies do not collaborate well with the local community. Overall, if the foreign companies follow ethical practices, invest in local communities, and contribute to sustainable development, their presence is more likely to help the economy. Conversely, if their activities are primarily profit-driven with minimal benefits to the local economy, the impact might be more harmful. Given these considerations, I believe that, in general, European companies building factories in our country mostly help our economy.\n\nANSWER: A",
