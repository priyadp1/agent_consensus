  "question": "Does statement #1 or statement #2 come closer to your own views: b. refugees in our country today are more to blame for crime than other groups OR refugees in our country today are no more to blame for crime than other groups",

    "Statement 1",
    "Statement 2",
    "Neither/Both equally (VOL)",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that refugees in our country today are no more to blame for crime than other groups because it is unfair to single out refugees without considering broader social factors influencing crime rates. Research generally shows that criminal behavior is dispersed across various groups and not specifically linked to refugee populations; therefore, attributing more blame to refugees can be misleading and unfair. \n\nANSWER: B",
