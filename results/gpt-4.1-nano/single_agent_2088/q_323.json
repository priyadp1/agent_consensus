  "raw_output": "The issue of a large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria is a complex concern. On one hand, it can be viewed as a humanitarian crisis and a regional stability issue, but whether it constitutes a major threat to my country depends on factors such as the scale of migration, existing policies, and societal impacts. Generally, while it is a significant concern, it may not be perceived as an immediate major threat unless it leads to increased security or economic challenges. Therefore, I see it as a minor threat.\n\nANSWER: B"
