        "raw_output": "Given the unpredictable nature of geopolitics and Iran's historical stance, it is uncertain whether they would only use nuclear weapons for defensive purposes or consider other options. While some might argue that nuclear deterrence would be their goal, others suggest that the potential for offensive use cannot be entirely dismissed due to strategic or ideological motivations. Considering the risk factors and international tensions, it seems more plausible that the use of nuclear weapons could extend beyond purely defensive purposes if deterrence fails or if internal leadership perceives a strategic advantage. Therefore, I believe it is not likely they would limit their use solely to defense.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Given the geopolitical context and Iran's strategic posture, it is plausible that if Iran developed nuclear weapons, they would be primarily used as a deterrent rather than for offensive purposes. Nations often acquire nuclear capabilities to prevent external threats and avoid direct confrontation, which suggests a defensive intent. Historically, countries with nuclear arsenals have emphasized deterrence to maintain security and regional influence, and Iran's own rhetoric often frames nuclear development as a means of national defense rather than aggression. Therefore, it seems more likely they would use them for defensive purposes only rather than initiating conflict.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The likelihood of Iran using nuclear weapons solely for defensive purposes depends on various geopolitical factors, including regional security dynamics, alliances, and strategic calculations. Historically, Iran has maintained a stance emphasizing deterrence and defense, but the possession of nuclear weapons could potentially be used as a strategic tool to influence regional power balances. However, the use of nuclear weapons, even defensively, carries enormous risks, including escalation and international repercussions. Given these considerations, it is difficult to be certain that Iran would strictly limit itself to defensive use; the possibility of offensive application cannot be entirely ruled out, influencing the perception of their likely intentions. Therefore, while actual use might be intended as deterrence, the potential for offensive use cannot be dismissed.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Given the complex geopolitical context and historical patterns, nuclear weapons often serve primarily as deterrents rather than tools for offensive use. While Iran has publicly emphasized a defensive stance, the actual likelihood of using nuclear weapons solely for defensive purposes appears less certain, since once a nuclear arsenal exists, the risk of escalation or offensive use remains a concern. The perceived tendency toward deterrence does not guarantee they would strictly confine their use to defensive purposes, especially considering strategic and regional factors. Therefore, based on these considerations, it seems more plausible that they might not be limited to defensive use only.\n\nANSWER: B",

While the potential for misuse or offensive use cannot be entirely ruled out due to political or ideological pressures, the dominant tendency among nuclear-armed states is to promote nuclear deterrence as a security measure.

Nuclear deterrence generally promotes the idea of threatening or utilizing nuclear force for strategic advantage or coercion, which can escalate beyond purely defensive applications.
