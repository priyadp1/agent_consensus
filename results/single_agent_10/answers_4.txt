Question 4
In your opinion, how strong a sense of Islamic identity do Muslims in our country have--very strong, fairly strong, not too strong, or not strong at all?

In my view, Muslims in our country tend to have a fairly strong sense of Islamic identity. While it may not be uniformly or extremely strong for everyone, the majority probably feel a clear connection to their faith, reflecting cultural practices, community involvement, and personal beliefs. This moderate to high level of Islamic identity supports social cohesion and cultural continuity, though individual experiences and perspectives can vary widely.
