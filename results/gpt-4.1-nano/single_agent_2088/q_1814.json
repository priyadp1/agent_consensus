  "question": "In your opinion, are India's laws too tough, not tough enough, or about right when it comes to punishing the crime of rape?",

    "Not tough enough",
    "About right"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that India's laws may not be sufficiently stringent when it comes to punishing rape because some offenders still manage to escape harsh penalties, and there have been instances where justice has not been served adequately. Strengthening laws and ensuring strict implementation can serve as a stronger deterrent and provide better justice for victims. Therefore, I think the laws are not tough enough.\n\nANSWER: B",
