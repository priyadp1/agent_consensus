        "raw_output": "My reasoning is that Russia's support of the Syrian government has contributed to the continuation of the civil conflict, resulting in significant humanitarian crises and suffering for the Syrian people. While some argue it helps stabilize the region or geopolitical interests, the negative humanitarian impact and the prolongation of violence lead me to oppose this support. I believe that international efforts should prioritize peace and the well-being of the civilians affected rather than supporting a regime involved in ongoing conflict. Therefore, I oppose Russia's support of the Syrian government.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I do not have personal opinions, but I can analyze the situation. Russia's support of the Syrian government has been a contentious issue. Proponents argue that Russia has helped stabilize the Syrian government and fight extremist groups, which can be viewed as supporting regional stability. Opponents, however, criticize Russia's involvement for potentially prolonging the conflict, humanitarian issues, and undermining efforts for a political solution. Given the complexity, individuals' support or opposition may depend on their perspective on international intervention and the impact on civilians. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe that Russia's support of the Syrian government is a complex issue. On one hand, some argue that Russia helps stabilize the Syrian regime and counter terrorism, which could be seen as supporting international security. On the other hand, this support has contributed to prolonging conflict and humanitarian suffering, raising ethical concerns. Given the importance of prioritizing human rights and the well-being of civilians, I oppose this support. \n\nANSWER: B",

Supporting a government believed to be responsible for civilian casualties and prolonged violence raises serious ethical concerns. Promoting a peaceful political solution and protecting human rights should take precedence over strategic interests. Therefore, I believe that opposition is justified in this context.\n\nANSWER: B",
