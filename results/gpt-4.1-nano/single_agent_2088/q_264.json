  "question": "Does our government cooperate too much, not enough, or about the right amount with the United States government?",
  "options": [
    "Too much",
    "Not enough",
    "About right"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe the government cooperates about the right amount with the United States because maintaining balanced cooperation can allow for effective collaboration on issues such as trade, security, and international relations while preserving national sovereignty. Excessive cooperation might lead to too much influence from the U.S., potentially undermining our own policies and interests. Conversely, too little cooperation could hinder beneficial alliances and collaboration that are crucial for addressing global challenges. Striking a moderate level ensures both independence and constructive engagement. \n\nANSWER: C"
