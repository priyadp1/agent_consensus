        "raw_output": "The movement of large numbers of refugees from countries like Iraq and Syria can pose various challenges for a host country, including security concerns, social integration issues, and economic impacts. However, whether this is viewed as a major threat depends on the country's capacity to manage such flows and its political stance on migration. In many cases, refugees are seen more as a humanitarian concern rather than a direct threat, especially when the country has established systems to support and integrate them. Therefore, I believe it is generally regarded as a minor threat rather than a major one. \n\nANSWER: B",
