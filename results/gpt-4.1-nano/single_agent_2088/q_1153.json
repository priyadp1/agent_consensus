  "question": "Do you think that the war in Syria will end in the next year, end in the next five years, or will it continue for more than five years?",
  "options": [
    "In the next year",
    "In the next five years",
    "It will continue for more than five years",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The conflict in Syria has persisted for many years, involving numerous internal and external actors, and has proven difficult to resolve swiftly. While diplomatic efforts continue, recent developments suggest that a comprehensive resolution within the next year is unlikely. It is more realistic to expect the situation to remain unresolved for several more years, potentially extending beyond five years. Therefore, I believe the war will continue for more than five years. \n\nANSWER: C",
