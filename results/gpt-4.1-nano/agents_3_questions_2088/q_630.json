        "raw_output": "I oppose Ukraine becoming a member of the Eurasian Economic Union. This is because the EEU includes Russia, which has been involved in actions that are viewed as hostile or threatening to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Joining such an organization could be seen as aligning closely with Russia's interests, thereby undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and its aspirations for closer ties with Western institutions. Moreover, considering the ongoing conflict and political tensions, accession could potentially exacerbate regional instability rather than promote economic integration or cooperation.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I oppose Ukraine becoming a member of the Eurasian Economic Union because it could undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and economic independence. The union, primarily led by Russia, has political and economic associations that Ukraine may not align with, especially given ongoing conflicts and tensions. Joining such a union might also limit Ukraine's ability to pursue closer ties with Western institutions and could exacerbate divisions within the country. Therefore, I believe opposing is the better stance to preserve Ukraine's national interests and sovereignty.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I oppose Ukraine becoming a member of the Eurasian Economic Union. Ukraine's integration into this union, which includes Russia and other countries that have complex and often strained relations with Ukraine, could compromise Ukraine's sovereignty and align it more closely with interests that are not aligned with its own national priorities. Given the geopolitical tensions and the ongoing conflict involving Russia, such a membership could also escalate regional instability and hinder Ukraine's pursuit of closer ties with Western institutions. Therefore, I believe that maintaining independence from the Eurasian Economic Union is in Ukraine\u2019s best interest.\n\nANSWER: B",
