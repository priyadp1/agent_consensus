        "raw_output": "I believe that missile strikes can be a necessary step to defend Pakistan from extremist groups because they may incapacitate or deter dangerous elements that threaten national security and stability. Such measures, if carefully targeted, can prevent attacks and protect civilians. However, it's also important to consider the potential for collateral damage and the importance of comprehensive strategies that include intelligence, community engagement, and legal processes to effectively combat extremism in the long term. Overall, if missile strikes are used judiciously and as part of a broader counter-terrorism approach, they can be justified as a necessary measure for national defense.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I believe that missile strikes can be a necessary measure to defend Pakistan from extremist groups, especially when diplomatic efforts fail to curb violence and terrorism. These strikes can serve as an effective tool to eliminate threat sources and ensure national security. However, it is also important to consider the potential collateral damage and the impact on civilian populations, which can sometimes undermine long-term stability and peace. Therefore, while I see the strategic importance of such strikes in defending the country, they should be employed thoughtfully, with proper oversight and safeguards to minimize harm. Ultimately, defense measures must balance security needs with respect for human rights and the rule of law.\n\nANSWER: A",
