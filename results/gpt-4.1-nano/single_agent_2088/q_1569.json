    "Number 1 - Parliamentary and presidential elections should be held as soon as possible, so that a new government can take office quickly",
    "Number 2 - Elections should be delayed until political parties have enough time to organize"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe it is more important to ensure that political parties have adequate time to organize before holding elections. This allows for a more stable and representative government, reducing the risk of poorly organised campaigns or unrepresentative outcomes. Although quick elections can lead to swift governance, they may also result in instability or a lack of public trust if parties are unprepared. Therefore, postponing elections until parties are ready helps promote a more organized and effective democratic process.\n\nANSWER: B",
