Additionally, various government initiatives and legal reforms indicate efforts to address and combat the issue, but reports of assault and related crimes continue to surface frequently. This ongoing visibility and reported rise in cases could point to a genuine increase or at least a heightened recognition of the problem, although it is also possible that improved reporting and awareness contribute to this perception.
