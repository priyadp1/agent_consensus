  "options": [
    "Will eventually replace US",

    "Will never replace US"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe China has not yet surpassed the United States in overall global influence, military power, technological innovation, and economic leadership, but it is rapidly advancing toward challenging U.S. dominance. While China is a formidable rising power and its influence continues to grow, it has not yet fully replaced the U.S. as the world's leading superpower. Therefore, I think future dominance is possible, but it has not yet happened.\n\nANSWER: A",
