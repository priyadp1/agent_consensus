Question 2
Which statement comes closer to your own views, even if neither is exactly right? Using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world, Relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism

I believe that relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism.

My reasoning is that while military action can be effective in targeting specific threats, excessive use of force often fosters resentment and ideological extremism among affected populations. This can increase support for terrorist groups and perpetuate cycles of violence. Sustainable solutions usually require a combination of security measures and efforts to address underlying issues such as social disenfranchisement, political grievances, and ideological narratives. Therefore, a balanced approach that avoids over-reliance on military force is more likely to reduce terrorism in the long term.
