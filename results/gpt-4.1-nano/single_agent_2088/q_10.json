  "question": "Do you think this change in the working conditions for ordinary workers is largely because of the way the world has become more connected or mostly for other reasons?",
  "options": [
    "Largely more connected",
    "Other reasons"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the change in working conditions for ordinary workers is primarily due to other reasons. While increased global connectivity has certainly played a role in shaping modern work environments, factors such as technological advancements, economic shifts, corporate policies, and shifts in labor regulations have had a more direct and significant impact on how work conditions evolve. These factors influence employment practices, workplace safety standards, and employee rights more immediately than the general interconnectedness of the world. Therefore, the primary drivers behind these changes are rooted in internal economic and social developments rather than just the global connectedness.\n\nANSWER: B"
