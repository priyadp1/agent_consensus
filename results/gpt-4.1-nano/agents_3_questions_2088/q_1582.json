        "raw_output": "Hosni Mubarak was the long-time President of Egypt who was widely criticized for his authoritarian rule, suppression of political dissent, and human rights abuses. While some may have viewed him more favorably during his time in power, especially among supporters or those who appreciated stability, the general global consensus after his resignation tends to be quite unfavorable due to the widespread protests and grievances that led to his ousting. Given this context, my opinion aligns more with a negative assessment, reflecting a recognition of his authoritarian legacy and the negative consequences of his leadership.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "Hosni Mubarak was a prominent Egyptian leader who ruled for many years but was also associated with authoritarianism and corruption. Due to his complex legacy, many people have mixed or negative opinions about him. Over time, especially after his resignation and death, public perception has generally been more critical, viewing his leadership less favorably. Therefore, I would select somewhat unfavorable as an appropriate reflection of this complex sentiment.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Hosni Mubarak was the long-time President of Egypt who was ousted during the Arab Spring protests in 2011. His leadership was marked by political stability but also accusations of authoritarianism, human rights abuses, and corruption. Public opinion about him tends to be highly divided: some may recall a period of relative stability and economic development, while others remember repression and lack of democratic freedoms. Considering this, I would say that his reputation among the general public is more likely to be viewed unfavorably, especially in recent years, due to the circumstances of his fall and subsequent legal issues. Therefore, I lean toward an unfavorable assessment.\n\nANSWER: D",
