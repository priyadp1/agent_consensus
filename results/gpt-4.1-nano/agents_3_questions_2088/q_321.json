        "raw_output": "I believe the best scenario for the world would be one where no single country dominates completely, as this could lead to power imbalances and conflicts. While strong leadership from a major power can provide stability and innovation, it also risks misuse of influence or policies that may not be in the global interest. A balanced, cooperative international approach or a scenario where power is shared might foster peace, equality, and sustainable development more effectively than a single dominant nation. Since the question asks for choosing from the given options, I would lean toward a scenario where neither country is the sole leading power because cooperation and shared leadership could better serve global stability and progress.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Considering the future, I believe that a multipolar world where both the U.S. and China share influence could promote stability, cooperation, and balanced development. This scenario might prevent the dominance of a single superpower, reduce conflicts, and encourage global collaboration on issues like climate change and economic stability. While each power has its own strengths and challenges, mutual influence could foster a more equitable and resilient international system. Therefore, I think having both countries as leading powers would be beneficial for the overall well-being of the world.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe that a world where either the U.S. or China holds predominant influence could offer stability, but having multiple powers share leadership might promote cooperation and balance, potentially leading to a more adaptable and resilient global system. However, if I must choose one scenario that is likely to foster the best outcome for the world, I would lean toward a scenario where no single country dominates entirely, encouraging multilateral engagement and shared leadership. Since option C suggests both leading powers without emphasizing dominance by one, it may facilitate global collaboration and reduce the risks associated with unipolarity or bipolar tension. Therefore, I believe that a balanced power scenario would be most beneficial for the world's future. \nANSWER: C",

Having multiple influential powers can balance interests, reduce the risk of conflict, and promote shared responsibility in addressing global challenges such as climate change, economic stability, and security. It encourages multilateral engagement and avoids the pitfalls of dominance by a single nation, which can lead to tension and instability.

        "raw_output": "I believe that a scenario where no single country dominates the world aligns best with the goal of global stability, peace, and sustainable development. When power is shared or managed cooperatively, it reduces the risks of conflict, unilateral decision-making, and imbalance. Dominance by either the U.S. or China alone could potentially lead to geopolitical tensions or conflicts, which might undermine global progress. Therefore, prioritizing a balanced or shared leadership approach over unilateral dominance seems most beneficial for the world's future.\n\nANSWER: D",
