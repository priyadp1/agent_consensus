  "question": "Do you think this change in the availability of food in stores is largely because of the way the world has become more connected or mostly for other reasons?",
  "options": [
    "Largely more connected",
    "Other reasons"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the recent changes in the availability of food in stores are primarily due to factors other than global connectivity. While increased interconnectedness has made supply chains more efficient and transparent, many disruptions have resulted from local issues such as climate change, labor shortages, transportation problems, and policy decisions. These factors have had more immediate and tangible impacts on food availability than the broader effects of the world's increased connectedness. Therefore, I think these shifts are mainly driven by reasons other than the way the world has become more connected.\n\nANSWER: B",
