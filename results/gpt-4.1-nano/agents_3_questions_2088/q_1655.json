        "raw_output": "I believe that having experts, rather than elected officials, make decisions based on what they think is best for the country could be beneficial because it allows for decisions based on expertise and knowledge rather than political considerations. However, it might also lead to a lack of accountability and reduce the influence of the public\u2019s voice in governance. Therefore, it might be somewhat good, but with potential drawbacks. \n\nANSWER: B",

However, relying solely on experts can also raise concerns about accountability and representation, as it may reduce the influence of the public's voice in governance. While expert decision-making could improve policy quality, it might undermine democratic legitimacy and responsiveness. Therefore, I see it as a somewhat good approach but not ideal.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Allowing experts, rather than elected officials, to make decisions based on what they believe is best can have both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, experts often have specialized knowledge and technical skills that can lead to more informed and efficient policymaking, potentially avoiding populist decisions that lack expertise. On the other hand, this system could disconnect the decision-making process from the democratic will of the people, reduce accountability, and risk decisions being made based on personal or ideological beliefs of the experts rather than public interest. Overall, many people might see this as a limited or risky form of governance because it diminishes democratic control and transparency.\n\nANSWER: D",
