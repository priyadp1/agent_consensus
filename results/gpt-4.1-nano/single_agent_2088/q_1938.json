  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad",
    "Neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the increased role of Islam in politics can have both positive and negative implications depending on how it influences governance and social cohesion. If it promotes values like justice, compassion, and social welfare, then it can strengthen community bonds and promote ethical policies. However, if it leads to exclusion or conflicts with secular principles, it might undermine the diversity and pluralism that are essential for a healthy democracy. Ultimately, whether this trend is good or bad depends on the specific context and how it impacts the rights and freedoms of all citizens. \n\nANSWER: C",
