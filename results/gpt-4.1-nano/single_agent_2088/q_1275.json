  "question": "As I read another list of statements, for each one, please tell me whether you completely agree, mostly agree, mostly disagree or completely disagree with it...Our people are not perfect, but our culture is superior to others.",
  "options": [
    "Completely agree",
    "Mostly agree",
    "Mostly disagree",
    "Completely disagree"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that no culture is inherently superior to others, as each culture has its unique strengths and weaknesses. Claiming that our culture is superior might overlook valuable qualities present in other societies and can foster a sense of arrogance rather than humility. Recognizing our imperfections is important, but asserting cultural superiority is problematic because it may promote unhealthy nationalism or intolerance. Therefore, I mostly disagree with the statement as it oversimplifies complex cultural dynamics and can be divisive.\n\nANSWER: C",
