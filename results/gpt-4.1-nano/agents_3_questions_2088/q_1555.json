While his influence was significant within the region, his ability to lead on broader world issues was often limited by internal constraints and regional complexities.

While he demonstrated some initiative on the international stage, his influence was constrained by internal and regional considerations, suggesting a moderate level of confidence in his capacity to consistently do the right thing regarding world affairs.
