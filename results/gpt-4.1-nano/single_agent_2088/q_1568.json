  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Pervez Musharraf's leadership was marked by significant military and political influence in Pakistan, with some efforts to modernize the country and maintain stability. However, his tenure was also marred by controversies, including accusations of authoritarianism, political repression, and issues regarding governance and democratic freedoms. His foreign policy actions were often pragmatic but sometimes driven by national interests that did not always align with broader international perspectives. Given the mixed record and the complex regional dynamics, confidence in his ability to consistently do the right thing on world affairs is uncertain. Therefore, I have some confidence but remain cautious about his overall judgment and priorities.\n\nANSWER: B",
