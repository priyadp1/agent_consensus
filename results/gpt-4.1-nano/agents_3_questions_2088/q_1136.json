        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can influence domestic prices in various ways. When a country imports products from abroad, if the foreign products are cheaper, it may lead to a decrease in domestic prices due to increased competition. Conversely, if the imported goods are more expensive or if trade restrictions raise costs, prices might increase. Additionally, trade can also bring in more variety and availability of goods, which could stabilize or influence prices in different ways. Overall, the impact of international trade on domestic prices can vary depending on the specific economic context, types of goods involved, and trade policies. Therefore, trade can either raise, lower, or have no significant effect on prices, making it difficult to give a definitive answer that applies universally.  \nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can influence domestic prices in different ways. When a country imports goods, if those goods are cheaper internationally, it can lead to lower prices domestically, making exports more competitive. Conversely, increased trade can also lead to higher prices if demand is strong or if imported products are costly due to tariffs or supply chain issues. Overall, the net effect depends on various factors like trade balance, tariffs, demand, and the relative costs of goods. Therefore, trade does not have a consistent effect of increasing or decreasing prices universally; it can cause prices to go up, down, or remain stable. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can have mixed effects on the prices of products in a country. When a country imports goods, increased supply or access to cheaper foreign products can push domestic prices down, leading to a decrease. Conversely, trade can also lead to higher prices if it introduces imported goods that are more expensive or if trade policies raise costs. Overall, the net impact often depends on specific circumstances, trade balance, and economic conditions, so it's not universally one-way. For this reason, the effect of trade on prices might not make a significant difference in some cases, or it may vary depending on the situation.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can have varying effects on domestic prices depending on the circumstances. Imported goods might be cheaper, leading to lower prices domestically, but if trade introduces higher-cost products or tariffs increase costs, prices could rise. The overall impact is context-dependent and not necessarily one-directional. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that trade does not consistently increase or decrease prices across the board. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can influence domestic prices in different ways depending on numerous factors such as the types of goods traded, trade policies, and market conditions. Sometimes imported goods are cheaper, leading to lower prices domestically, while other times tariffs or increased costs of trade can drive prices up. Additionally, the overall impact varies based on the specific economic context, so the effect of trade isn't uniformly one way or the other. Given these considerations, I believe that trade does not consistently lead to either an increase or decrease in prices and often has a mixed or negligible impact.\n\nANSWER: C",

Sometimes, cheaper imports can drive prices down, while other times tariffs or supply chain issues can push prices up.

        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can impact domestic prices in various ways depending on factors such as the cost of imports, tariffs, supply chain dynamics, and market competition. While in some cases, cheaper imported goods may reduce local prices, in other situations, increased trade costs or tariffs can cause prices to rise. Given the complexity and variability of these effects, there isn't a consistent pattern where trade always leads to higher or lower prices. Therefore, I believe the most appropriate answer is that trade can influence prices differently, often resulting in no clear or uniform change.\n\nANSWER: C",
