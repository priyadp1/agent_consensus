        "raw_output": "The police in Egypt have historically been a complex institution, often seen as a source of stability but also criticized for abuses of power and human rights violations. Their influence on the country's progress is mixed; while they can maintain order and contribute to security, their reputation for repression and lack of accountability has sometimes hindered social and political development. Therefore, their influence can be considered somewhat bad, as their actions may undermine trust in the system and hamper efforts toward positive societal change.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The police in Egypt have long played a complex role in the country's social and political landscape. While they are essential for maintaining law and order, there have been numerous reports of misconduct, abuse of power, and suppression of dissent. These actions have often led to a negative perception among the public and have contributed to social unrest. Therefore, their influence tends to be viewed as more harmful than helpful, particularly when it involves violations of citizens' rights and freedoms. Based on this context, their influence in Egypt is more aligned with being somewhat bad or very bad, depending on specific circumstances and periods. Given the general outlook and evidence of negative impacts, I would categorize their influence as leaning toward very bad.  \n\nANSWER: D",

However, concerns about abuses of power, corruption, and suppression of dissent have also tainted their reputation. On balance, the influence of the police tends to be viewed as more harmful than helpful in the context of broader social and political development. Therefore, their influence is mostly perceived as somewhat bad, with some considering it very bad due to issues like human rights violations and lack of accountability.\n\nANSWER: C",
