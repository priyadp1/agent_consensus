However, I also recognize that disparities still exist, and some groups continue to face hardship and poverty, which suggests that not everyone benefits equally.

A significant portion still faces poverty, inequality, and social challenges. Therefore, I feel most people do not necessarily have a better life overall, even if some are rich and others are poor. This suggests a nuanced perspective, but given the options, I lean toward disagreement because the disparities overshadow the general improvements.\n\nANSWER: C",
