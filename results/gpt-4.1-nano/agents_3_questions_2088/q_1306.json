        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, the affordability of health care in our country has generally worsened for many individuals. Rising costs of insurance premiums, high out-of-pocket expenses, and increasing prices for medical treatments and prescription drugs have made it more difficult for people to access affordable care. Despite some efforts to improve healthcare coverage or reduce costs, these measures have not been sufficient to offset the overall trend of increasing healthcare expenses. Consequently, many Americans find health care less affordable now than they did five years ago.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, the affordability of health care in our country has generally worsened for many individuals. While there have been efforts to expand coverage and control costs, rising premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses have made it more difficult for average families to afford necessary medical care. Additionally, in some regions, limited access to affordable providers and high prescription drug costs have further impacted affordability negatively. Therefore, it seems that, on the whole, the situation has deteriorated rather than improved.\n\nANSWER: B",

Despite some improvements in certain areas, rising medical costs, insurance premiums, and out-of-pocket expenses have made health care less accessible and more financially burdensome for a significant portion of the population. While there have been efforts to expand coverage or reduce costs in specific sectors, the overall trend indicates a decline in affordability for most people. Therefore, it can be said that the situation has gotten worse.\n\nANSWER: B",
