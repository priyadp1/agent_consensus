  "question": "Overall, do you think the U.S. response to the political situation in Egypt has had a positive impact or a negative impact on the way things are going now in Egypt?",
  "options": [
    "Positive",
    "Negative",
    "Neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the U.S. response has had a mixed impact, but overall it seems to lean more towards the negative side. Historically, interventions or strong foreign influence can sometimes lead to instability or unanticipated consequences, especially if not carefully managed. In the case of Egypt, various policies have at times exacerbated tensions or failed to promote genuine stability and democracy, leading me to view the overall effect as more negative than positive. \n\nANSWER: B"
