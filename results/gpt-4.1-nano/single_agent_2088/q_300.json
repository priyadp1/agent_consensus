  "options": [
    "Completely agree",
    "Mostly agree",
    "Mostly disagree",
    "Completely disagree"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that religious leaders should have a role in shaping moral and ethical discussions in society, but when it comes to direct involvement in political decision-making, I think it\u2019s important to maintain a clear separation between church and state. This ensures that government policies serve all citizens equally, regardless of their religious beliefs, and prevents any one faith from unduly influencing laws that affect everyone. While religious leaders can offer valuable moral guidance, I prefer that political decisions remain based on democratic processes and secular principles. Therefore, I mostly disagree with the idea that they should play a larger role in politics. \n\nANSWER: C"
