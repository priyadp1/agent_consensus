While violence and loss of personal freedoms are serious issues, the core challenge lies in social cohesion and ensuring that Muslim communities are able to participate fully and harmoniously within the broader society. If integration is hindered, it can also lead to misunderstandings, segregation, and social fragmentation, which may, in turn, increase the risks of violence or restrictions, but the primary worry is about societal inclusion and acceptance.\n\nANSWER: C",
