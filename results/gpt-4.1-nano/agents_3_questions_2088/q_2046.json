        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "My perspective is that people's trustworthiness can vary greatly depending on individual experiences and cultural contexts. While I believe that many people are generally trustworthy, there are situations where caution is warranted. Therefore, I lean towards being careful in dealing with people to ensure safety and personal interests are protected, especially in unfamiliar settings or with strangers. Given this nuanced view, I would opt for a cautious approach rather than assuming most people can be trusted outright.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that trust in others varies depending on individual experiences and cultural context, but generally, I tend to lean toward trusting most people based on the assumption that many individuals act with good intentions. However, I also acknowledge that caution is sometimes necessary to avoid potential harm or disappointment. Therefore, I would choose to trust most people but remain somewhat cautious. After considering both perspectives, I think option A reflects a generally optimistic view of human nature and social trust. \n\nANSWER: A",

Personal experiences have shown me that some individuals act with good intentions, but there are also instances where caution protects oneself from potential harm.

While I tend to generally trust most people, I recognize that a degree of caution is necessary to navigate potential risks and avoid being overly naive. This balanced perspective leads me to choose a cautious yet trusting approach, but since the question asks whether most people can be trusted or if carefulness is needed, I would lean towards maintaining trust while being aware of possible caveats. Therefore, my answer is A, trusting most people but with a mindful attitude.\n\nANSWER: A",

While some individuals are genuinely trustworthy, others may require careful handling to avoid potential risks. Balancing trust with caution seems prudent, but since the question asks whether most people can be trusted or if caution is needed, I am inclined to believe that, on average, most people can be trusted with reasonable caution. Therefore, I choose to affirm a generally trusting attitude, provided I remain aware of potential exceptions.\n\nANSWER: A",
