        "raw_output": "I believe that people leaving our country for jobs in other countries is a significant issue because it can lead to a loss of skilled workers, reduce the country's economic growth, and weaken the local workforce. While migration is a common part of the global economy, a large outflow of talent could have serious negative impacts on national development. Therefore, I consider it a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "People leaving our country for jobs in other countries can have significant implications. When skilled workers and talented individuals leave, it can lead to a loss of human capital, which affects economic growth and development. It may also signal underlying issues like lack of opportunities or dissatisfaction with local conditions, potentially weakening community stability and morale. While some might see this as a way for individuals to pursue better prospects, from a national perspective, a high rate of emigration for work can be seen as a serious concern that hampers progress and sustainability. Therefore, I consider it a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "People leaving our country for jobs in other countries can have significant impacts on the economy, workforce, and community stability. If many talented or essential workers migrate elsewhere, it could hinder national development or create labor shortages. While migration is a common global phenomenon and can sometimes benefit both senders and receivers, a high rate of emigration driven by economic conditions or lack of opportunities can be concerning. Therefore, I would consider it a very big problem if it is happening on a large scale, though in some contexts it might be less critical. Overall, viewing the potential widespread loss of workers as substantial, I think it is a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I believe that people leaving our country for jobs in other countries can be a very big problem. When significant numbers of individuals, especially skilled workers, migrate abroad, it can lead to a shortage of essential skills and labor within the country. This can hamper economic growth, reduce national development, and weaken the local workforce, potentially causing long-term social and economic challenges. While some migration is natural and can have benefits, a large outflow driven by economic necessity signals serious issues that need addressing. Therefore, I consider it a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",
