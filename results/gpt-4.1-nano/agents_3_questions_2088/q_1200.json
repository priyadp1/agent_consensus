        "raw_output": "In many countries, access to quality education can vary based on gender, societal norms, and economic factors. Traditionally, some societies have provided more educational opportunities to men due to cultural preferences or policies that favor male education, while others have emphasized gender equality. Considering ongoing efforts towards gender equality and increasing awareness of women's rights, it is increasingly seen that opportunities are becoming more balanced. However, disparities still persist in certain areas, with men sometimes having more access or support for higher education and women facing barriers. Given this context, I believe that generally, opportunities are about the same for both men and women when it comes to getting a good education, reflecting both progress and ongoing challenges.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "In many countries today, access to quality education has become more widespread, but disparities often still exist based on gender due to cultural, economic, and social factors. In some cases, men may have more opportunities due to traditional societal roles, while in others, efforts to promote gender equality have leveled the playing field. However, given the persistent gender gaps in various regions and contexts, it is common for many people to perceive that men generally have more opportunities when it comes to getting a good education, especially in societies where gender inequality remains prominent. Therefore, I believe that many would see men as having more opportunities overall in this regard.\n\nANSWER: A",

While progress has been made toward gender equality, disparities still often exist, particularly in rural or less developed areas where cultural or institutional barriers may limit opportunities for women. However, in more developed societies with progressive policies, the gap may have narrowed, leading to perceptions of equal or similar opportunities. Given the general context and ongoing challenges, many respondents might perceive that men tend to have more opportunities when it comes to getting a good education.\n\nANSWER: A",
