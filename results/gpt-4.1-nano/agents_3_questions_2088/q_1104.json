If their influence is seen as promoting stability, national pride, or security, one might consider it somewhat good. Conversely, if their presence leads to increased tension, conflict, or divisiveness, the influence might be viewed as somewhat bad or very bad. Without specific details about the country's situation, it's difficult to precisely judge. Given the potential for both positive and negative effects, and considering typical perceptions of such groups in different contexts, I lean toward viewing their influence as somewhat bad, especially if their actions or rhetoric contribute to social division or unrest.\n\nANSWER: C",

If their support contributes to stability, national pride, or positive political change, one might view their influence as somewhat or very good. Conversely, if their presence leads to divisiveness, extremism, or conflict, their influence would be considered bad. In many contexts, especially if there are concerns about extremism or social division, their influence might be seen as somewhat or very bad. Considering these factors, I believe their influence is more negative than positive in the current climate.\n\nANSWER: D",
