  "raw_output": "I believe that providing essential public services is important for the well-being of society, but I am also mindful of government spending and individual financial responsibility. Therefore, I lean towards supporting lower taxes even if it means fewer services because it encourages personal responsibility and keeps the economy more efficient. However, I recognize that those in need might benefit from more comprehensive services funded by higher taxes. Given my balanced view, I would prefer to prioritize lower taxes for individual benefit, while acknowledging the importance of services.\n\nANSWER: B",
