  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the U.S. benefits from being a member of the WHO primarily because global health issues, such as pandemics and disease control, require coordinated international efforts. The WHO provides valuable expertise, resources, and a platform for collaboration that can help prevent and manage health crises that could also impact the U.S. directly or indirectly. Despite some criticisms about its efficiency or decision-making, the overall advantages of global health security and information sharing suggest that the benefits are significant.\n\nANSWER: A",
