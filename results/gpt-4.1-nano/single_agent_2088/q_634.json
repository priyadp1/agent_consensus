  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe the United States has done a somewhat bad job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. While there have been efforts to contain and manage the pandemic, challenges such as inconsistent messaging, uneven resource distribution, and varying restrictions across states have impacted overall effectiveness. Public health responses have been complicated by political factors and logistical issues, which have limited the country's ability to respond as effectively as possible. Therefore, I would rate their handling as somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C"
