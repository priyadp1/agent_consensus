  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the spread of American ideas and customs can be seen as both beneficial and problematic. On one hand, it promotes cultural exchange, innovation, and global interconnectedness, which can lead to positive economic and social development. On the other hand, it may also threaten local cultures, traditions, and identities, leading to cultural homogenization. Overall, whether it is good or bad depends on how the spread is managed and its impact on diversity and local values. I think the positive aspects generally outweigh the negatives when approached thoughtfully. \n\nANSWER: A"
