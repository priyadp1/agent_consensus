        "raw_output": "I believe that political instability in Pakistan poses a minor threat to the well-being of the United States. While instability can have regional repercussions and impact counterterrorism efforts, Pakistan's nuclear capabilities and its strategic importance mean that instability there doesn't directly threaten the U.S. on a large scale. Nevertheless, ongoing turmoil could influence regional stability, which in turn might affect U.S. interests indirectly. Therefore, it is more of a minor concern compared to other global threats.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Political instability in Pakistan can have regional repercussions and potentially impact U.S. strategic interests, especially considering Pakistan's nuclear capabilities and its role in global counterterrorism efforts. However, given the current state of global priorities and the direct impact on U.S. national security, it is generally considered a minor threat rather than a major one. The U.S. is more directly concerned with more immediate or pressing international issues, although instability in Pakistan remains an important concern for long-term regional stability.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it may not directly threaten the overall well-being of the United States on a day-to-day basis, prolonged instability could influence American foreign policy and security interests in the region. Therefore, I consider it a minor threat, as it warrants attention but is unlikely to cause immediate or widespread harm to the U.S.\n\nANSWER: B",
