        "raw_output": "The Pakistani government has historically faced international pressure to crack down on extremist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has carried out attacks in India and elsewhere. While there have been efforts at times to curb these organizations, reports and evidence suggest that some elements within the state, intentionally or unintentionally, continue to support or at least tolerate such groups for strategic reasons. Officially, the government denies supporting these groups, but in practice, their policies and actions have often been aligned with tolerance or ambiguous support, which complicates efforts to clearly categorize their stance. Therefore, I believe they generally tolerate these groups rather than actively support or oppose them.\n\nANSWER: B",

While officially denying support for organizations like Lashkar-e-Taiba, some evidence and international concerns suggest that elements within Pakistan have, at times, tolerated or indirectly supported such groups, especially if they align with strategic regional interests. The state's stance has been inconsistent\u2014publicly opposing these groups but reportedly providing covert support or issuing ambiguous policies that can be interpreted as tolerating their activities.
