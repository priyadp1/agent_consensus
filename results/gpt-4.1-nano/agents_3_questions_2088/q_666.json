        "raw_output": "The United Nations has historically played a significant role in providing humanitarian aid, logistical support, and coordinating international assistance following major disasters like the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. They mobilize resources, facilitate aid delivery, and support recovery efforts, which is indicative of a substantial contribution. While individual member states often provide direct aid, the UN's collective efforts can be considered a major help in such situations, though perhaps not entirely decisive without national contributions. Overall, their involvement has been quite substantial, but not necessarily the sole or leading factor in the assistance effort.\n\nANSWER: B",

They mobilized resources, provided logistical support, and coordinated aid from member states, demonstrating a substantial level of assistance. While their role is important, the direct on-the-ground aid and relief efforts come primarily from individual countries, with the UN acting more as a facilitator. Therefore, I would rate the UN's assistance as a fair amount, acknowledging their support but recognizing that the bulk of aid came from national governments.\n\nANSWER: B",

They helped mobilize resources and organize humanitarian missions, which were essential for effective aid delivery. Their actions mainly supported and coordinated the efforts of individual countries and organizations rather than providing direct on-the-ground aid themselves.
