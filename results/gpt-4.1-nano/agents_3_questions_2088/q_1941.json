        "raw_output": "In many families, household finances are often a shared responsibility, but culturally, men have historically held more influence over financial decisions, especially in traditional or patriarchal contexts. However, this can vary greatly depending on societal norms, individual family dynamics, and whether the family emphasizes gender equality. Generally, in many surveys and studies, men tend to be perceived or positioned as having more decision-making power regarding household finances due to social and economic factors. Therefore, the most common perception aligns with men having more influence.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "In many contemporary families, the influence over household finances varies widely depending on cultural, social, and individual factors. Traditionally, men were often perceived as the primary decision-makers in financial matters, especially in more patriarchal societies. However, in many modern households, women tend to have significant or even dominant influence, reflecting shifts towards gender equality and shared decision-making. Some families see a balanced influence from both partners, while others may have unclear or undecided arrangements. Thus, there is no single pattern applicable universally; cultural and social contexts heavily influence this dynamic. Given this diversity and the trend toward more egalitarian decision-making in many societies, the most common perception is that influence is shared roughly equally. Therefore, I believe that, in many households, men and women generally share about the same influence over household finances.\n\nANSWER: C",

However, in modern settings, women often have equal or greater influence, especially as they participate more actively in financial matters and shared decision-making. Given these dynamics, the influence can vary greatly depending on cultural, socioeconomic, and individual family factors, but overall, it is common to see men having somewhat more influence on household finances in a traditional or average scenario.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Considering the diverse perspectives and the evolving nature of household decision-making, it appears that in many modern families, influence over finances is increasingly shared between men and women. Traditional gender roles are shifting towards more egalitarian approaches, and studies suggest that women often have significant influence or share decision-making power in household finances. While some families still reflect traditional hierarchies where men hold more authority, the trend points towards a more balanced influence overall. Therefore, I believe that in general, men and women tend to have about the same influence in many households.\n\nANSWER: C",
