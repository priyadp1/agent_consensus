While cultural differences are important, they should not prevent the implementation of democratic systems that promote participation and fairness. Many Muslim-majority countries have successfully adopted democratic processes or are moving in that direction, demonstrating that democracy is not exclusive to the West and can be effective elsewhere when appropriately adapted.\n\nANSWER: B",
