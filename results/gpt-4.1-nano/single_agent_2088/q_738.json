  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Barack Obama demonstrated a cautious approach to military interventions, often emphasizing the need for international cooperation and approval when considering military force. For example, in Libya, he sought UN Security Council approval before participating in NATO-led airstrikes. Similarly, in Syria, he asked Congress and prioritized multilateral support before actions. These behaviors suggest that he has sought international approval prior to using military force.\nANSWER: A"
