Their influence can also promote competition that benefits consumers. However, there are concerns about these companies prioritizing profits over local interests, potentially leading to the loss of local businesses and influence over national policies. Overall, the impact depends on how well these companies are regulated and integrated into the local economy.

        "raw_output": "Large companies from other countries can influence our country\u2019s economy and society in various ways. Often, they bring innovation, jobs, and access to new products, which can be beneficial. However, their control over local markets can also undermine local businesses, lead to loss of jobs domestically, and prioritize profits over social or environmental concerns.
