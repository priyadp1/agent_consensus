These actions threaten regional security and have the potential to escalate into broader conflicts, which could disrupt global peace. While the level of threat is serious, many experts consider it to be more of a moderate danger compared to those with nuclear powers or superpower conflicts. Therefore, it poses a substantial but not the highest level of threat to stability and peace in the region and the world.\n\nANSWER: B"
