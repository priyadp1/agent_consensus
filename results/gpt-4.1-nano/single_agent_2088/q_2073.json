  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that freedom is more essential because it allows individuals to pursue their own goals, express themselves, and make choices that shape their lives. While equality ensures fairness, the absence of freedom could limit personal development and innovation. Without personal freedom, efforts toward equality might be constrained or enforced uniformly, potentially suppressing individual differences and aspirations. Therefore, prioritizing freedom supports a society where everyone can exercise their rights and contribute uniquely. \n\nANSWER: A",
