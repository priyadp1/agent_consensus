When it comes to Germany’s decision-making in the European Union, do you think Germany has too much influence, has too little influence or has about the right amount of influence?

I believe that Germany has about the right amount of influence in the European Union. Germany is one of the largest and most economically powerful member states, which naturally grants it significant influence. However, the EU is designed to ensure a balance among member states, and other countries also hold substantial sway. This balance helps facilitate cooperation and consensus across diverse nations. Therefore, Germany’s influence seems proportional to its size and importance within the EU, and I do not see it as excessively dominant nor too marginalized.
