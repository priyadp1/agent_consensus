  "raw_output": "The perception of the U.S. by other countries can vary based on recent leadership changes, policies, and global events. Since Joe Biden took office, many countries have viewed his approach as more diplomatic and cooperative compared to previous administrations, potentially leading to more positive sentiments. However, these perceptions are complex and influenced by multiple factors. Given the generally positive diplomatic signals and efforts to rebuild alliances, it is reasonable to assume that foreign views are somewhat more positive than before, but not necessarily significantly so. Therefore, I believe other countries view the U.S. a little more positively.\n\nANSWER: B",
