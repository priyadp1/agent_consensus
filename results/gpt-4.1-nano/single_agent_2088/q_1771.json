  "question": "Now I'm going to read you a list of things the United States might do to help the Mexican government combat drug traffickers in our country.  Would you support or oppose it...deploying U.S. troops in Mexico.",
  "options": [
    "Support",
    "Oppose"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Deploying U.S. troops in Mexico is a complex and sensitive issue. On one hand, it could potentially bolster efforts to combat drug trafficking, which might reduce violence and improve security. On the other hand, involving U.S. military forces directly in Mexico's territory could lead to sovereignty concerns, escalate violence, or create diplomatic tensions. Overall, I am cautious about military intervention on foreign soil and prefer supporting other diplomatic or law enforcement efforts. Therefore, I oppose it.\n\nANSWER: B",
