These covert operations tend to be conducted by other agencies, which raises questions about their legitimacy and transparency.

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Many people believe that drone attacks, especially in regions like Pakistan, have been conducted without the explicit approval of the Pakistani government. This perception stems from the clandestine nature of some operations and the lack of transparent communication from authorities. Such actions often raise concerns about sovereignty and legality, leading to suspicions that these strikes are carried out by external actors or military agencies without formal consent. Therefore, I lean towards agreeing that the drone attacks are done without the approval of the Pakistani government.\n\nANSWER: A",

This lack of transparency and official endorsement suggests they are not always sanctioned by Pakistani authorities, which raises concerns about sovereignty and accountability.

Many reports suggest that these covert operations are carried out by foreign agencies or military entities with limited transparency or formal consent from Pakistan's authorities. This lack of official approval fuels skepticism about whether the Pakistani government officially endorses or authorizes these strikes.

Although Pakistan often publicly protests these attacks and calls for transparency, evidence and reports suggest that some of these operations are carried out covertly by foreign actors, primarily the United States, without direct formal approval from Pakistani authorities. The lack of clear, official authorization and the secretive nature of these operations support the view that they are happening without Pakistani government consent.\n\nANSWER: A",
