  "question": "On the subject of Iraq, did your country make the right decision or the wrong decision to use military force against Iraq?",
  "options": [
    "Right decision",
    "Wrong decision"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the decision to use military force against Iraq was the wrong one. The invasion led to significant long-term instability in the region, resulted in numerous civilian casualties, and did not produce the clear weapons of mass destruction that justified the initial intervention. The aftermath of the conflict underscored the importance of thorough diplomatic solutions over military action. Therefore, the consequences suggest that the decision was ultimately detrimental rather than beneficial.\n\nANSWER: B"
