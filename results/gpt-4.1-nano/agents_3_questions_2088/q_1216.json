        "raw_output": "The influence of the Central Security Forces in my country is somewhat bad because while they are essential for maintaining order, there are concerns about overreach and human rights abuses in some cases. Their actions sometimes lead to a feeling of repression among the population, which affects public trust. However, I recognize that they also help in preventing chaos and ensuring national security, so their influence is not completely negative. Overall, I believe their impact leans more towards being problematic rather than beneficial. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The influence of the Central Security Forces in my country is quite complex and depends heavily on recent events and the context in which they operate. In many cases, they are seen as necessary for maintaining order and protecting citizens from threats, which can be viewed as a positive contribution to stability and security. However, there are also concerns about human rights violations, abuse of power, and excessive use of force, which undermine public trust and suggest a negative impact on the societal fabric. Overall, the perception of their influence tends to lean towards the negative due to these issues, although some still view them as essential for national security.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The influence of the Central Security Forces is often viewed as a double-edged sword. In some countries, they are seen as essential for maintaining order and safety, which can be beneficial for the stability and development of society. However, in other contexts, their actions are associated with repression, human rights violations, or abuse of power, which can undermine trust and social cohesion. Given the complex impact they have depending on the specific country and situation, the influence is likely more negative than positive in many cases, particularly where reports of misconduct or excessive force are prevalent. Therefore, I believe their influence is somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C",

However, concerns over possible human rights violations, misuse of power, and excessive force suggest that their impact often leans toward negative, fostering distrust and social tension. Given the overall perception and recent reports of misconduct, I believe their influence tends more toward the problematic side.
