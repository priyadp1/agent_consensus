While national interests and security concerns often take precedence, there is also an awareness of the global impact and the importance of international relationships. This balance suggests a somewhat significant level of consideration, but perhaps not to the extent that it would be characterized as a \"great deal.\" Therefore, I would choose \"fair amount\" as the most accurate reflection of my perception.\n\nANSWER: B",
