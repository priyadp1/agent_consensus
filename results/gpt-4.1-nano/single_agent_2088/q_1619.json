  "question": "If your country and ____ got into a serious military conflict, do you think that the United States would or would not use military force to defend our country? b. North Korea",
  "options": [
    "Would use military force",
    "Would not use military force",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Given the current international relations and the United States' historical stance, it is unlikely that the U.S. would use military force solely to defend its country in a conflict with North Korea unless there was a direct attack or significant threat. The U.S. generally prefers diplomatic and economic measures in this situation. Therefore, I believe the U.S. would not use military force to defend our country against North Korea in a hypothetical scenario like this.\n\nANSWER: B",
