  "question": "As I read a list of groups and organizations, for each, please tell me what kind of influence the group is having on the way things are going in your country.   Is the influence of Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad or very bad in your country? ",
  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe TEPCO's influence has been somewhat bad because, while the company plays a crucial role in producing electricity for the country, its handling of the Fukushima disaster and concerns over safety and environmental impact have caused public distrust. The accident highlighted significant issues with safety protocols and decision-making processes, which have negatively affected public perception and confidence. Therefore, I see TEPCO's influence as more harmful than beneficial, at least in the current context.\n\nANSWER: C"
