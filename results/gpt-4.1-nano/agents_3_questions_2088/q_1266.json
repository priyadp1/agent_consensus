        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Among the options, I believe the European Union is taking the most balanced and comprehensive approach to fixing the global economic crisis. The EU often emphasizes coordinated policies, social safety nets, and sustainable growth initiatives across member countries, which can address both immediate economic stability and long-term resilience. While the United States and China also play significant roles, their approaches can sometimes be more influenced by national priorities or geopolitical considerations. The EU's focus on multilateral cooperation and integrated economic strategies positions it well to address global challenges effectively.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "The approach to fixing the global economic crisis depends on multiple factors such as policy measures, coordination with international partners, and long-term strategic planning. The United States has a large consumer economy and can influence global markets through fiscal stimulus and monetary policy; China has substantial economic growth potential and can exert influence through infrastructure investments and development programs; the European Union, with its integrated policies and emphasis on sustainable development, aims to address issues collaboratively among member states. Each has strengths and limitations, but overall, coordinated efforts among these major economies are essential for effective resolution rather than reliance on any single entity. Therefore, I believe that a collaborative, multi-polar approach is most promising for fixing the crisis.\n\nANSWER: D",

      "2": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe the European Union is taking the best approach to fixing the global economic crisis because it has a comprehensive strategy that combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, and coordinated policies among member states. The EU's emphasis on sustainable growth and social cohesion allows for more stable recovery measures compared to the more isolated or short-term focused actions seen elsewhere. Additionally, the EU's commitment to green investments and digital innovation could foster long-term resilience, making its approach potentially more holistic and effective in addressing both immediate and structural issues.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe that addressing the global economic crisis effectively requires international coordination and comprehensive strategies. While the United States has significant influence through monetary and fiscal measures, its approach often prioritizes short-term stimulus. China's focus on infrastructure and development can promote growth, but may lack immediate stability without supportive policy coordination. The European Union stands out because it emphasizes sustainable growth, social cohesion, and long-term resilience through integrated policies and green investments. This holistic approach makes the EU's strategy potentially more effective in fostering stable recovery and structural reform. Therefore, I consider the European Union to be taking the best approach.\n\nANSWER: C",

While the European Union demonstrates a balanced strategy emphasizing multilateral cooperation and sustainable policies, the United States and China also have significant influence through their fiscal, monetary, and development initiatives. Given the interconnected nature of global markets, collaboration among these powers seems most promising. However, if I must choose the best single approach currently taking the lead, I recognize the EU's comprehensive and cooperative stance as particularly constructive in fostering long-term resilience. Therefore, I select the European Union as the leading approach at this time.\n\nANSWER: C",
