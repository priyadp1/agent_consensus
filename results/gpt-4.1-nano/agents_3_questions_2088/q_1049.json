        "raw_output": "Foreign companies in the mining industry in our country often bring economic development and create employment opportunities. However, the extent to which they provide jobs for local workers can vary based on company policies, local workforce skills, and regulations. In many cases, there is some level of employment for local people, but a significant portion of the workforce might be composed of foreign managers or specialists, and local employment may not be maximized. Given this, it seems they provide jobs for local workers somewhat well, but not entirely or very well.\n\nANSWER: B",

      "1": {
        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "My answer is likely B because foreign companies in the mining industry often create employment opportunities for local workers, but the extent of their contribution can vary depending on the specific company practices, local policies, and the overall economic context. While they do provide jobs, these are sometimes limited or not as integrated into local communities, which might prevent them from being seen as providing jobs \"very well.\" Therefore, \"Somewhat well\" seems to best capture the general perception that foreign mining companies contribute to employment but perhaps not extensively or perfectly. \n\nANSWER: B",

      "2": {
        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Foreign companies in the mining industry often bring significant investment and operational capacity to the country. However, their commitment to employing local workers varies depending on company policies, local labor laws, and community engagement. In many cases, foreign mining firms do create jobs for local residents, but these jobs may not always be the most numerous or the most accessible for the local population. Some companies might also prioritize expatriate workers or bring in skilled labor from abroad, which can limit the employment opportunities for local workers. Overall, while foreign companies do contribute to local employment, the extent of their impact on providing jobs specifically for local workers is moderate. Therefore, the most appropriate choice to reflect this situation is \"Somewhat well,\" acknowledging their contribution but also recognizing room for improvement.\n\nANSWER: B",
