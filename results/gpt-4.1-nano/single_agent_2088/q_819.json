  "options": [
    "Very important",
    "Somewhat important",
    "Not too important",
    "Not important at all",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Allowing human rights organizations to operate without government interference is very important because these organizations often work to protect individuals' fundamental freedoms, hold authorities accountable, and promote justice. When they can function freely, it helps ensure that abuses do not go unchecked and that there is a mechanism for civic oversight. Limiting their operation could hinder efforts to promote equality and human dignity, which are essential for a fair and open society. Therefore, I believe it is very important to maintain their independence and freedom to operate without interference.\n\nANSWER: A"
