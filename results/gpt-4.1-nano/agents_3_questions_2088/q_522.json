While my local Imam or sheik is crucial for personal and immediate support, national leaders often provide more comprehensive and standardized religious guidance that aligns with our country's legal and social frameworks. Religious leaders on television can be influential but may not always address specific personal concerns or regional differences. Leaders from outside the country, such as al-Azhar or Saudi Imams, offer valuable insights but might not always be directly applicable or sensitive to my local circumstances.\n\nANSWER: B",
