        "raw_output": "I believe the change in the availability of good-paying jobs is mostly due to other reasons. While increased global connectivity has created opportunities and expanded markets, many of the shifts in job quality and availability are driven by factors such as technological automation, economic policies, education systems, and corporate practices. These internal dynamics often have a more direct impact on the types of jobs available and their pay scales than global connectivity alone. Therefore, I see other reasons as the primary driver behind these changes.\n\nANSWER: B",

While greater connectivity can create opportunities and facilitate international trade and investment, it is not the sole driver. Many local and national policies, innovation, and workforce development play crucial roles in shaping job quality and pay scales. Therefore, I think the primary reasons extend beyond just the interconnectedness of the world.\n\nANSWER: B",

While increased global connectivity has played a role in expanding markets and opportunities, many of the shifts in job quality and pay are more directly linked to technological advancements, automation, policy changes, and economic factors that are not solely driven by globalization. These elements have had a significant impact on labor markets, often benefiting some sectors while disadvantaging others, which can't be entirely explained by the world's increased interconnectedness.\n\nANSWER: B",

While increased global connectivity can facilitate access to new markets, investment, and knowledge transfer, it is not the main reason for changes in job quality and wages. More significant influences include technological progress, automation, economic policies, and education systems, which shape labor markets more directly.

While globalization and increased connectivity have created new opportunities and expanded markets, the main factors influencing job quality and pay seem to be technological automation, policy decisions, education quality, and corporate practices that operate largely within national or regional contexts. These internal shifts have a more immediate and measurable impact on the types of jobs available and their wages than global interconnectedness alone.

While globalization has opened markets and facilitated international trade, many of the shifts in job quality are driven by technological automation, economic policies, workforce skill levels, and corporate practices.
