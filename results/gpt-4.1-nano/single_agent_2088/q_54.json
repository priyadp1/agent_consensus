  "question": "Again, which one better describes George W. Bush...He makes decisions based entirely on U.S. interests or He takes into account European interests when making decisions",
  "options": [
    "He makes decisions based entirely on U.S. interests",
    "He takes into account European interests"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "George W. Bush's foreign policy decisions, especially during his presidency, were primarily driven by U.S. national interests, such as security concerns after 9/11 and promoting American influence globally. While European interests and perspectives are often considered in international diplomacy, they generally did not play a central role in shaping his most consequential policies. Therefore, he is better characterized as making decisions based entirely on U.S. interests.\n\nANSWER: A"
