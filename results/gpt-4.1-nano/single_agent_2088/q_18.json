  "question": "I am going to read you the same list.  Does...you can openly say what you think and can criticize the (state or government)...describe our country very well, somewhat well, not too well or not well at all?",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the level of openness and freedom to criticize the government can vary depending on the context and location within the country. If I feel that citizens generally can openly express their opinions without fear of repercussions, I would lean toward describing our country as well. However, if I perceive constraints or risks associated with criticizing authorities, I may not consider the country to be well described in that regard. Overall, my impression is that, in many areas, it might be somewhat well, but not perfectly. Therefore, I think the best fit is B. \n\nANSWER: B"
