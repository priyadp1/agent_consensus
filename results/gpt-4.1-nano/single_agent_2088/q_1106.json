  "question": "Overall, how likely do you think it is that in the next 50 years, robots and computers will do much of the work currently done by humans?",
  "options": [
    "Definitely happen",
    "Probably happen",
    "Probably NOT happen",
    "Definitely NOT happen",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe it is probably happening because technological advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and machine learning are progressing rapidly. Historically, many tasks that required human effort have been automated, and there's a strong likelihood that this trend will continue, resulting in robots and computers taking over a significant portion of current human work over the next 50 years. This shift could lead to increased productivity and changes in employment patterns, making it plausible that the majority of work will be automated within this timeframe.\n\nANSWER: B",
