While there is awareness and some efforts to address the issue, there is also a lot of room for improvement in terms of collective action, policy support, and personal responsibility. Public opinion often reflects concern but sometimes limited engagement or skepticism about the effectiveness of individual or collective measures. Therefore, I would rate their performance as somewhat good.\n\nANSWER: B",

Many people are increasingly aware of the importance of reducing carbon emissions, adopting more sustainable lifestyles, and supporting policies aimed at environmental protection. However, the overall effort is still inconsistent and falls short of the urgent action needed, which suggests that while there is positive engagement, it is not yet at a very good level.
