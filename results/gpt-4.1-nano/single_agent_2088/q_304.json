  "raw_output": "The large movement of refugees from countries like Iraq and Syria can pose significant challenges for hosting countries, including issues related to security, economic stability, and social cohesion. Such mass movements might strain resources and infrastructure, and sometimes lead to tensions within communities. While some may view this as a serious threat, others might see it as a humanitarian concern or an inevitable consequence of regional instability. Based on these considerations, I believe it can be considered a major threat due to its potential to impact national security and stability.\n\nANSWER: A"
