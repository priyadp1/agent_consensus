        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that maintaining a balanced approach is important. Increasing defense spending might be necessary if there are perceived threats or regional tensions, but it should also be carefully scrutinized to ensure funds are used effectively. Keeping spending about the same allows for stability and predictable planning, especially if current levels meet our national security needs. Decreasing spending could risk vulnerabilities, while increasing without clear justification might divert resources from other critical areas like education or healthcare. Therefore, I think it is prudent to keep spending about the same until we see evidence that adjustments are warranted.\n\nANSWER: B",

Ensuring adequate defense resources can protect our country's sovereignty and contribute to stability both domestically and internationally. However, any increase should be balanced against other public priorities to ensure responsible fiscal management. Therefore, I lean toward keeping it about the same, possibly with a moderate increase if necessary.\n\nANSWER: B",
