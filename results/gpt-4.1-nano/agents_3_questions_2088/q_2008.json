        "raw_output": "I tend to trust European standards more when it comes to auto safety because European countries often have stringent safety regulations, comprehensive testing procedures, and a strong emphasis on consumer safety. European agencies like Euro NCAP are well-known for their rigorous crash tests and safety ratings, which contribute to higher safety standards in vehicles sold across Europe. While American standards are also significant and influence global auto safety, I perceive European standards as generally more thorough and consistent in ensuring vehicle safety for consumers. Therefore, I lean towards trusting European standards more in this context.\n\nANSWER: A",
