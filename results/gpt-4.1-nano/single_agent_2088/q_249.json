    "Very good",

    "Very bad"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that when foreigners buy our country companies, it can bring both opportunities and challenges. While it can lead to increased investment, new technologies, and job creation, it may also raise concerns about national control and economic independence. Overall, the impact depends on how the investments are managed and whether they benefit the broader population. Therefore, I lean towards considering it as somewhat good, given the potential for positive economic impacts while acknowledging some risks. \n\nANSWER: B"
