    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "China\u2019s territorial disputes with India have historically been a source of tension in the region, occasionally flaring into military confrontations and diplomatic disagreements. While these disputes are significant for regional stability and international relations, they have not led to full-scale war recently. Nonetheless, they are serious enough to warrant concern about stability and peace in Asia. Considering these factors, I believe they are a serious issue but perhaps not the most urgent or immediate threat currently faced globally.\n\nANSWER: B"
