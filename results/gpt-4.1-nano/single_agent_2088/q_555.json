  "question": "If China were to use military force against Taiwan, should the United States use military force to defend Taiwan, or not? ",
  "options": [
    "Should use force",
    "Should not use force"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "The decision for the United States to use military force in defense of Taiwan depends on multiple factors, including international alliances, the potential consequences of conflict, and U.S. foreign policy principles. Many argue that supporting Taiwan aligns with commitments to regional stability and democratic values, which could justify U.S. intervention to prevent further aggression. Others believe that engaging in military conflict might escalate tensions and threaten broader peace and security in the region. Considering the importance of strategic stability and the reassurance of allies, I believe that the U.S. should be willing to defend Taiwan militarily if China were to use force.\n\nANSWER: A"
