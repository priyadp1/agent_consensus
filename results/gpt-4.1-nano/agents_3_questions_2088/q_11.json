        "raw_output": "I believe that using military force against countries that may seriously threaten us without having already attacked can be justified sometimes, primarily when there is credible evidence of an imminent threat that poses a significant danger to national security. Acting preemptively in such cases can help prevent future attacks and protect citizens, but it should be carefully weighed against the potential for escalation and unintended consequences. This approach requires strong intelligence and diplomatic efforts to ensure that military action is truly necessary and proportionate. Therefore, I see it as sometimes justified.\n\nANSWER: B",

Preemptive action may be necessary in certain circumstances where there is credible evidence of imminent threat.

Such actions can escalate conflicts unnecessarily and may lead to unintended consequences. Therefore, I believe that military force in these situations is justified only under strict conditions, such as clear evidence of imminent danger and the exhaustion of diplomatic options. This careful approach helps maintain international stability and prevents unnecessary violence.\n\nANSWER: B",
