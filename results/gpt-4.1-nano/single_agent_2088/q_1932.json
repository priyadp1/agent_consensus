  "question": "Do you think the Pakistani government authorized the military operation that killed Osama bin Laden, or don't you think so?",
  "options": [
    "Yes, authorized the operation",
    "No, did not authorize the operation"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "There is considerable debate and lack of official confirmation regarding whether the Pakistani government authorized the military operation that led to Osama bin Laden's death. Some sources suggest that elements within the government may have known or been aware of the operation, but official authorization has not been publicly confirmed, and it remains a contentious issue. Given this ambiguity and the absence of definitive evidence, I do not believe that the Pakistani government officially authorized the operation.\n\nANSWER: B",
