Historically, strikes have led to significant labor reforms and increased public awareness about workers' rights. While they may not always bring immediate results or influence policy directly, they can galvanize public opinion and put pressure on governments or companies to negotiate. Therefore, I believe labor strikes are generally quite effective in influencing government actions, especially when public support is strong and media coverage is significant.\n\nANSWER: A",

Historically, strikes have led to significant policy changes and legislative reforms when they garner enough support and publicity. However, their effectiveness often depends on the scale, the public's support, and the economic context. While they can be impactful, they may not always result in immediate or broad policy changes, especially if they face opposition or if government responses are resistant. Therefore, they are generally somewhat effective but not guaranteed to produce desired outcomes in every case.\n\nANSWER:B",
