        "raw_output": "In my opinion, United States policies tend to increase the gap between rich and poor countries. This is because many policies, such as trade agreements and intellectual property rules, often favor wealthier nations and corporations, which can make it more difficult for poorer countries to develop their economies and access vital resources or technology. Additionally, aid and development policies may sometimes be tied to strategic interests that do not prioritize reducing global inequality. Therefore, these policies can inadvertently widen the disparity between rich and poor nations rather than decrease it or have no effect. \n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "In my view, United States policies tend to increase the gap between rich and poor countries. This is because many policies favor developed nations through trade agreements, intellectual property rights, and economic aid structures that often benefit wealthier nations more significantly. Such policies can reinforce existing inequalities by making it harder for poorer countries to develop independently, access markets fairly, or gain technological advancements. While some policies aim to promote global development, the overall effect leans towards widening the disparity. \n\nANSWER: A",
