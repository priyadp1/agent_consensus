        "raw_output": "Since 1991, many countries have experienced significant social, political, and economic transformations. While some positive developments like increased personal freedoms and economic growth have brought people closer together, other factors such as economic inequality, political polarization, and social tensions have often driven divisions and conflicts. The overall impact on how well people get along with one another depends largely on specific contexts, but generally, the influence has been mixed. Given the complexity and the predominant challenges to social cohesion, I believe the changes have had a negative impact on interpersonal relations. Therefore, I select bad influence as it best captures the nuanced reality of increased divisions and social fragmentation observed in many societies over that period.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Since 1991, many countries have experienced significant political, social, and economic changes, which have had mixed effects on social cohesion. For some, modernization and increased connectivity have fostered understanding and collaboration, leading to better relationships among people. Conversely, rapid change and instability in certain regions may have increased divisions, mistrust, and conflicts. Considering the overall spectrum, the influence appears to be more mixed with some positive effects but also notable negative consequences. However, on balance, these changes seem to have largely challenged social harmony rather than enhanced it.\n\nANSWER: C",

In some contexts, these changes have either improved or strained relationships among people. Given the complexities and varying experiences across regions, I believe these changes have generally made it more challenging for people to get along with one another, due to increased social inequalities, political polarization, and cultural tensions. Therefore, I consider that these developments have had a bad influence overall.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The period since 1991 has seen profound changes in many countries that affect social cohesion. While some positive aspects such as increased freedoms and economic opportunities have helped bring people closer, there have also been significant challenges like rising inequality, political polarization, and social tensions that tend to drive divisions and reduce mutual understanding. These conflicting trends suggest that, on balance, the overall influence has been more negative than positive, making it harder for people to get along with each other.
