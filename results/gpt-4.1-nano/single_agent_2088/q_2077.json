  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that security is more important because without it, freedom can lead to chaos and harm. Ensuring safety and protection creates a stable environment in which true freedom can be exercised and maintained. While freedom is vital, it should not come at the expense of security, especially in times of threat or crisis. A secure foundation allows individuals and society to enjoy liberties without constant fear. Therefore, prioritizing security provides a necessary balance that supports freedom in the long run.\n\nANSWER: B",
