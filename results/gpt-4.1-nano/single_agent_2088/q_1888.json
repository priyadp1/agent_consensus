  "question": "How much have politicians benefited from the changes since 1989/1991- a great deal, a fair amount, not too much, or not at all?",
  "options": [
    "Great deal",
    "Fair amount",
    "Not too much",
    "Not at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Politicians have arguably benefited to some extent from the changes since 1989/1991, as reforms often aimed to increase their influence and power, sometimes leading to greater opportunities for self-interest and control. While some might argue that these changes have not significantly enhanced politicians' benefits or have even limited their power, the overall trend suggests they have gained notably more than before. Therefore, I believe politicians have benefited a fair amount from these changes.\n\nANSWER: B",
