  "raw_output": "The U.S. trade deficit with China has been a significant concern for many policymakers and members of the public because it can imply loss of manufacturing jobs and an imbalance in economic relations. While some see it as a serious issue needing substantial policy action, others consider it less problematic or believe it reflects broader economic factors. Overall, I believe it poses a notable but manageable challenge that warrants attention without being classified as the most severe problem. Therefore, I consider it somewhat serious.\n\nANSWER: B",
