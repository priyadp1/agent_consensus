        "raw_output": "The future of political instability largely depends on current global and national trends. If political tensions and conflicts continue to escalate or remain unresolved, instability may worsen. Conversely, improvements in governance, cooperation, and conflict resolution could lead to stability. However, recent patterns suggest ongoing uncertainty and unresolved conflicts, making it more likely that political instability could get worse in the next five years. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe political instability might worsen over the next five years due to increasing global tensions, economic uncertainties, and rising polarization within many countries. These factors tend to contribute to more frequent or severe political upheavals, so I expect the situation to deteriorate rather than improve or stay the same.\n\nANSWER: B",

These issues tend to exacerbate instability unless significant efforts are made to address root causes, which currently seem uncertain.
