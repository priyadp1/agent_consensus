        "raw_output": "I would choose C because Gerhard Schroeder, who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1998 to 2005, was known for his pragmatic approach to international relations and economic policies. While he was generally considered competent on foreign affairs, some of his decisions, particularly regarding military interventions and alliances, did raise questions about his consistency and alignment with broader international concerns. Therefore, I have a moderate level of confidence in his ability to do the right thing regarding world affairs, but not wholeheartedly.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "During Gerhard Schroeder's time as Chancellor of Germany from 1998 to 2005, he was generally seen as a pragmatic leader who aimed to balance national interests with international cooperation. However, some critics questioned his decisions on certain foreign policy issues, including his stance on Iraq and Iraq's invasion in 2003, which caused some diplomatic tensions and diminished trust among some international observers. While he maintained overall support within Germany and had confidence in his leadership, his international reputation on some geopolitical matters was mixed. Therefore, my confidence in him to consistently do the right thing regarding world affairs is moderate but not unwavering.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder served as Chancellor from 1998 to 2005 and was known for his pragmatic approach to international relations, especially during Germany's involvement in NATO and the European Union. While he aimed to represent Germany\u2019s interests effectively, opinion on his stance regarding world affairs varied, especially after his support for the Iraq War in 2003, which was controversial and affected his credibility on global issues. Some people may have had confidence in his leadership during that time, but others could have been skeptical of his decisions. Overall, given the mixed perceptions and the controversial nature of some policies, I might have limited confidence in his global decision-making.\n\nANSWER: C",

His approach was generally balanced, and while opinions about his foreign policy decisions were mixed, I believe he had a reasonable level of competence in handling international issues. However, due to some criticisms and diplomatic tensions, I do not feel extremely confident, but I trust that he aimed to act in Germany\u2019s and the broader global interest.\n\nANSWER: B",
