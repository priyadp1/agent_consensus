If the incident caused injuries, damage to workplaces, or safety concerns, it likely led to lost time at work.

        "raw_output": "The earthquake and tsunami likely disrupted daily routines and work schedules for many households, making it probable that some members experienced lost work time due to damages, safety concerns, or displacement. However, without specific personal or community context, it is difficult to determine whether I or my household members personally lost time at work. Given the widespread impact of such natural disasters, it is reasonable to assume that at least some individuals experienced this consequence. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is that yes, I or members of my household lost time at work during this event.\n\nANSWER: A",
