        "raw_output": "I have very little confidence in Sheik Hassan Nasrallah's ability to do the right thing regarding world affairs, as his leadership of Hezbollah often involves actions that are considered confrontational and destabilizing on the international stage. His organization has been involved in various conflicts and has complicated diplomatic relations with multiple countries, which reduces my trust in his decision-making concerning global issues.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah is a highly controversial figure associated with Hezbollah, an organization with complex political and military roles primarily in Lebanon and the Middle East. His leadership has been involved in regional conflicts and tensions, often aligning with Iran and other allied groups. Given his association with militant activities and the contentious nature of Hezbollah\u2019s influence on regional stability, confidence in his decision-making regarding global affairs is understandably limited. Many international observers and governments view Hezbollah with suspicion and concern, which further diminishes trust.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "answer": "C",

While he is seen by some as defending Lebanese sovereignty and resisting foreign influence, his organization is considered a terrorist group by many countries and is involved in regional conflicts. This complex and often polarized perception makes it difficult to have full confidence in his judgment on global affairs, leading me to feel not too much confidence but also not entirely dismissing his intentions. \n\nANSWER: C",
