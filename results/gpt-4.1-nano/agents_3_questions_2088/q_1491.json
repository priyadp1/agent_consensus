        "raw_output": "The Turkish government\u2019s stance toward democracy in the Middle East has historically been complex and nuanced. While Turkey has expressed support for democratic principles, its actions sometimes appear to be motivated by strategic interests that do not always align with promoting democracy. For instance, Turkey has supported certain regimes or engaged in policies that seem to undermine democratic movements in the region, especially when such movements conflict with its geopolitical goals. Overall, Turkey tends to both support and oppose democracy depending on the circumstances, making it difficult to categorize its position as strictly favoring or opposing. Therefore, considering the mixed nature of its policies and priorities, I believe the government\u2019s stance is mixed.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The Turkish government has historically exhibited a nuanced approach to democracy in the Middle East. While it often promotes democratic ideals and supports regional stability, some critics argue that its actions sometimes reflect strategic interests that may undermine democratic principles. Overall, perceptions are mixed, but there's evidence suggesting a tendency to support democratic movements selectively, depending on geopolitical considerations. Therefore, I believe the government\u2019s stance is complex and cannot be solely categorized as favoring or opposing democracy, but leans more towards a nuanced or supportive position in certain contexts.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "My perception is that the Turkish government's stance towards democracy in the Middle East has been complex and somewhat contradictory. On one hand, Turkey has historically positioned itself as a supporter of democratic values and has expressed support for democratic movements. On the other hand, its foreign policy has sometimes been driven by strategic interests that appear to undermine democratic developments in some neighboring countries. This nuanced approach can be seen as both favoring and opposing democracy depending on the context, making it difficult to categorize simply.\n\nANSWER: C",
