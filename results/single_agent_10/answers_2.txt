Question 2
Which statement comes closer to your own views, even if neither is exactly right? Using overwhelming military force is the best way to defeat terrorism around the world, Relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that leads to more terrorism

I believe relying too much on military force to defeat terrorism creates hatred that can lead to more terrorism. While military action may be necessary in certain situations, heavy reliance on it often alienates populations, fuels resentment, and can serve as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. Sustainable solutions tend to involve a combination of security measures, intelligence, community engagement, and addressing underlying social and political issues. Therefore, the second statement aligns more with a nuanced, long-term approach to counter-terrorism than the idea that overwhelming military force is the best way.
