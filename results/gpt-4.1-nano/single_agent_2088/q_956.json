These effects can ripple across various countries, especially those heavily involved in trade with China or reliant on its manufacturing sector. While some regions may be less impacted depending on their economic ties, overall, it\u2019s reasonable to consider that what happens in China has a substantial effect on the global economy.\n\nANSWER: A",
