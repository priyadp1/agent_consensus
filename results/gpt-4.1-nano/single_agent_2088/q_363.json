    "No confidence at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I have moderate confidence in Barack Obama to do the right thing regarding world affairs. During his presidency, he demonstrated a commitment to diplomacy and multilateralism, which are positive indicators. However, like many leaders, he also faced complex international challenges and sometimes made decisions that were subject to debate. Therefore, I believe he would likely act with some consideration of global interests, though not necessarily with the highest level of confidence.\n\nANSWER: B"
