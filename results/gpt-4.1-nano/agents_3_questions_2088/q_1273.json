There is often a perception that politicians are more responsive to special interests or partisanship than to the average voter's needs, leading to skepticism about whether their opinions truly matter to them.\n\nANSWER: C",

This creates a sense of disconnect and skepticism among the public regarding their representatives' concern for ordinary citizens.

While I acknowledge that some officials genuinely care, the overall sentiment leans toward skepticism about their level of concern for ordinary citizens. Therefore, my answer is mostly disagree, reflecting this cautious view.\n\nANSWER: C",
