        "raw_output": "I believe that the minimal resistance from the Iraqi military might be seen as a swift transition towards change, but it also raises concerns about the stability and legitimacy of the new order. Some might interpret the lack of resistance as a sign of potential internal issues or lack of support. Therefore, I would likely be disappointed because I would expect a more decisive or proud stand rather than surrender or minimal opposition.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I am not happy that the Iraqi military put up so little resistance because it suggests a lack of national resilience and strength, which could have complicated the stability and sovereignty of Iraq. A stronger resistance might have allowed Iraq to better defend its sovereignty and maintain control over its own future.

        "raw_output": "I am neither happy nor disappointed about the Iraqi military's lack of resistance as my personal feelings are not involved. However, from a perspective that considers the broader implications, minimal resistance might suggest a lack of organized defiance or preparedness, which could be seen as a disappointment if one values strong national defense and sovereignty. Conversely, some may feel relief or satisfaction if they viewed the invasion as inevitable and prefer a quick resolution. Given the complexity and varying opinions on this matter, I would choose B to reflect disappointment with the military's response, as a stronger resistance might have contributed to a more resilient and autonomous Iraqi defense.\nANSWER: B",
