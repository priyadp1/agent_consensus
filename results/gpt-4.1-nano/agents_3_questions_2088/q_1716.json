        "raw_output": "The future of Cuba after Fidel Castro's death is uncertain and depends on various factors, including political transitions, economic policies, and social changes. Historically, Fidel's leadership provided a strong, centralized control that maintained the status quo; his passing could lead to either significant reforms or increased instability. Given Cuba's lengthy history of economic and political challenges, it's plausible that substantial changes may take time, and the immediate impact might not drastically alter conditions. Therefore, it is likely that the overall situation will not change much in the short term.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "The death of Fidel Castro could lead to significant changes in Cuba's political and economic landscape. While some believe that his passing might open opportunities for reforms and improved conditions, others think that systemic issues and the existing government structure may maintain the status quo, resulting in little change. Given the complex nature of Cuba's political system and the potential for both positive and negative adjustments, it is difficult to predict a drastic shift either way immediately after his death. Therefore, it seems most plausible that conditions might not change much in the short term.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Fidel Castro's death could lead to significant changes in Cuba's political and economic landscape, potentially resulting in improvements if his successors enact reforms or worsened conditions if the transition leads to instability. However, it is also possible that the status quo persists in the short term due to institutional continuity. Therefore, the most balanced expectation is that there will likely be some change, but not necessarily a drastic shift either way. Given the uncertainty and the complex nature of Cuba's system, it seems probable that conditions would not change much immediately after his passing.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Given the historical context and the uncertainty surrounding Cuba's political and economic future, many experts believe that Fidel Castro's death might not lead to immediate drastic changes. The stability of the current system and the enduring influence of the existing leadership could mean that conditions remain relatively stable in the short term, though long-term shifts are possible depending on subsequent leadership and reforms.

While some stability might persist initially, the transition could open pathways for reforms or shifts\u2014positive or negative\u2014in the country's political, economic, and social landscape. Given the historical significance of Castro's leadership, his passing is likely to have substantial effects rather than leaving conditions largely unchanged.
