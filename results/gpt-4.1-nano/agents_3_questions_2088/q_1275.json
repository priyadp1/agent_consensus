        "raw_output": "I believe that while every culture has its strengths and weaknesses, the concept of declaring one culture as inherently superior to others is problematic. Cultures are diverse and reflect different histories, values, and ways of life; none can be objectively deemed superior in all respects. Additionally, the idea that our culture is superior might lead to arrogance or overlooking the positive aspects of other cultures. Therefore, I mostly disagree with the statement that our culture is superior to others, even if I recognize that none are perfect.\n\nANSWER: C",
