  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the use of military force can sometimes be necessary to maintain global order, especially in situations where diplomacy has failed or threats are imminent. However, I also think that military intervention should be a last resort, prioritized through international cooperation and legal frameworks to minimize harm and unintended consequences. Balancing the need for security with the importance of peace and stability makes me lean toward cautious support rather than outright endorsement. Therefore, I mostly agree with the statement.\n\nANSWER: B"
