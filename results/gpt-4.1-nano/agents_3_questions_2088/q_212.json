        "raw_output": "The United States historically has been involved in the internal affairs of many countries through diplomatic pressure, economic influence, military interventions, and support for certain political groups or leaders. While it sometimes asserts a policy of non-interference or claims to respect sovereignty, in practice, its actions suggest it often tries to influence internal political, economic, or social conditions in other nations. This pattern makes it more plausible that many people perceive the U.S. as an actor that actively attempts to influence other countries rather than remaining completely uninvolved.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "The United States has historically played an active role in influencing the internal affairs of other countries through diplomatic, economic, military, and covert means. While there are periods or administrations that may emphasize non-intervention, overall, the U.S. has a long-standing pattern of engaging in international influence efforts, whether to promote democracy, protect interests, or address security concerns. This involvement often includes supporting regime changes, intervening in conflicts, or exerting economic pressure. Therefore, I believe the U.S. tries to influence the internal affairs of other countries.\n\nANSWER: A",

While some may argue that it sometimes respects the sovereignty of other nations, there is considerable evidence that the U.S. actively attempts to shape events in other countries to align with its strategic, economic, or political interests. These actions suggest that the U.S. tries to influence the internal affairs of other nations more often than it stays completely out of them.\n\nANSWER: A",
