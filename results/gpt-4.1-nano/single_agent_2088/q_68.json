  "question": "As I read a list of groups and organizations, for each, please tell me what kind of influence the group is having on the way things are going in your country.

  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "Banks and major financial institutions play a complex role in many economies. In some cases, they contribute positively by providing essential services like loans, savings accounts, and investments that support economic growth and personal financial stability. However, in many countries, their influence is often viewed negatively due to practices such as prioritizing profits over customers, contributing to economic inequality, or engaging in risky behavior that can lead to financial crises. Overall, whether their influence is very good or very bad depends heavily on the specific circumstances of the country, but in many contexts, their negative aspects tend to overshadow the positives, leading to skepticism and criticism. Therefore, I believe their influence is more harmful than beneficial.\n\nANSWER: D"
