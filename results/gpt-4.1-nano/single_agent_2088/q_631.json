    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Based on societal observations and research, men often have advantages in areas such as economic opportunities, political representation, and physical safety, while women may face challenges related to gender-based disparities, workload, and safety concerns. Considering these factors, many might view men as having a generally better life due to these systemic advantages. However, individual experiences vary widely, which makes it difficult to definitively state that one gender has a better life universally. \n\nANSWER: A"
