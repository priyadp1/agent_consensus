        "raw_output": "The perception of immigration as a problem varies widely depending on social, economic, and political contexts. Some people see immigration as a significant challenge related to resource allocation, security, or cultural integration, making it a very big or moderately big problem. Others view it as less of an issue or not a problem at all, especially in countries with open policies or positive experiences with immigration. Given this diversity of opinions, I believe that on a national level, immigration currently remains a moderately big problem as it often sparks considerable debate but is not universally regarded as the most pressing issue.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The perception of immigration as a problem varies greatly depending on individual experiences and societal context. Some see immigration as bringing cultural diversity and economic contributions, viewing it as a manageable issue. Others see it as a significant challenge related to resource allocation, security, or social integration. Given these mixed perspectives, many people might see it as a moderate concern that warrants attention but isn't necessarily an urgent crisis. Therefore, I would categorize this as a moderately big problem.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "My view on immigration as a problem depends on several factors, including how it affects job opportunities, social cohesion, and public resources. While immigration can bring benefits such as diversity and economic growth, it also raises concerns about integration, public service strain, or security issues for some people. Personally, I believe that immigration is a moderately big problem because it is significant enough to be a concern but not so overwhelming that it dominates other issues facing the country.\n\nANSWER: B",
