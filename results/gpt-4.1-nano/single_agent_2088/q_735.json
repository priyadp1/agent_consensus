  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The relationship between Pakistan and the U.S. has seen fluctuations in recent years, often influenced by regional security concerns, counter-terrorism efforts, and diplomatic engagements. While there have been moments of cooperation and dialogue, underlying tensions and strategic disagreements persist, making it difficult to say that relations have definitively improved overall. Therefore, I believe they have not improved significantly in recent years.\n\nANSWER: B"
