        "raw_output": "Over the past 20 years, many societies have experienced shifts in family dynamics due to technological advances, globalization, and changing social norms. In some countries, these factors have led to weakening family ties as individuals become more socially and geographically dispersed, and traditional structures evolve. However, in other contexts, family bonds may have remained strong or even strengthened as families adapt to new challenges.
