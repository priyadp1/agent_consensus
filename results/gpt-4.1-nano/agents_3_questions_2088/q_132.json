However, these groups continue to pose a threat, indicating that the situation hasn't significantly improved across the board. Overall, the progress seems incremental rather than decisive, so things are somewhat better but still challenging. \n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "The Pakistani government has shown some initiatives to combat extremist groups, but challenges persist due to complex regional dynamics and internal security issues. While there have been some successes, such as operations against certain militant groups, other areas still face significant threats and occasional setbacks. Overall, progress is evident but limited, and in many aspects, the ground gained is fragile or uneven. Therefore, I believe the situation remains largely the same as before, with some improvements being counterbalanced by ongoing difficulties.\n\nANSWER: C",

However, the persistence of extremist activities and the ongoing threat suggest that they are still struggling to fully contain or eliminate these groups. Considering this, I think the situation is somewhat improved but not significantly enough to say they are making clear progress, nor have they entirely lost ground. Therefore, I would say things are about the same as they have been in the past.\n\nANSWER: C",
