        "raw_output": "U.S. economic aid to Pakistan has historically aimed to promote development, stability, and economic growth. While there have been positive impacts such as infrastructure development and humanitarian assistance, challenges persist including dependency, corruption, and sporadic policy effectiveness. Overall, the aid has contributed to some progress but often falls short of transformative change, leading me to think its impact is more nuanced and not overwhelmingly positive or negative. Therefore, I believe the impact is largely neutral, with some benefits but also significant limitations.\n\nANSWER: C",

It often helps fund infrastructure, health, and education projects, contributing to long-term growth. However, some critics argue that aid sometimes fosters dependency or doesn't lead to sustainable change. Given the overall benefits observed, I believe the impact is mostly positive.\n\nANSWER: A",

While aid can help improve infrastructure, health, and education, there are also concerns that it may not address underlying political or economic challenges effectively. Overall, the aid seems to have a somewhat mixed record, but many would argue that it leans towards a positive influence given the potential benefits and ongoing support.

While it has contributed to improvements in infrastructure, health, and education sectors, these benefits are offset by issues such as dependency, corruption, and limited sustainable impact.
