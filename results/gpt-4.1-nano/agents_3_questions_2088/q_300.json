        "raw_output": "I believe that religious leaders should not play a larger role in politics because such involvement can blur the separation between church and state, potentially leading to policies that favor specific religious views over inclusive governance. Politics should be guided by secular principles to ensure fairness and representation for all citizens, regardless of their individual beliefs. An increased role for religious leaders might also undermine the neutrality necessary for effective and unbiased policymaking. Therefore, I mostly disagree with the idea of religious leaders playing a larger role in politics.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that religious leaders should have a cautious yet meaningful role in politics. They can offer valuable moral guidance and reflect societal values, especially on ethical issues. However, it is important to maintain separation between religion and state to ensure that policies serve all citizens fairly, regardless of their faith. Therefore, I lean towards a moderate position, suggesting that while religious leaders can contribute constructively, their involvement should not be excessive to preserve political neutrality and inclusivity.\n\nANSWER: B",

However, I also think that their role should be balanced with secular authority to ensure fairness and inclusivity for people of all beliefs.
