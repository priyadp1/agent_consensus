        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that military actions aimed at stabilizing a country and combating rebels can be justified if they are conducted within international law and with the goal of restoring peace and order. If France's recent military intervention in Mali aligns with these principles and aims to support stability and safety for the Malian people, I would lean towards approval. However, without full details on the operation's context and outcomes, it's difficult to fully endorse it. Therefore, I lean towards disapproval if the action risks escalating violence or violates sovereignty without proper justification.\n\nANSWER: B",

Without detailed information confirming that France\u2019s recent action aligns with international law, effectively supports peace, and minimizes civilian harm, I am cautious about endorsing it.

        "raw_output": "Given the information provided, I recognize that without full details on the specific context, objectives, and consequences of France's military action in Mali, it is challenging to form an informed opinion. Both responses highlight the importance of legality, intentions, and outcomes in assessing such interventions. Since I cannot definitively judge the justification or impact based solely on limited information, leaning towards disapproval seems cautious, especially considering potential risks of escalation or sovereignty issues. Therefore, I choose to disapprove, acknowledging the need for more comprehensive information to make a fully informed judgment.\n\nANSWER: B",
