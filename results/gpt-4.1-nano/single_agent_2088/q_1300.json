  "raw_output": "Francois Hollande's tenure was marked by economic challenges both within France and in the broader European context. His government implemented some reforms and policies aimed at stabilizing the economy, but faced criticism for slow growth, high unemployment, and difficulties in dealing effectively with the European financial crisis. Public opinion was quite divided, and many felt his approach was inadequate to address the severity of the crisis. Given these factors, I believe his performance was more aligned with a somewhat bad job, considering the expectations and the ongoing economic difficulties during his presidency.\n\nANSWER: C",
