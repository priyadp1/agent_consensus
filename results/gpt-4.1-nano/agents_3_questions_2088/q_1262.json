        "raw_output": "I believe that the statement reflects a common perception supported by economic data and social discourse. Wealth distribution disparities tend to widen over time in many societies, with existing economic advantages often compounding, making it increasingly difficult for those at the lower end to catch up. While there are policies and efforts aimed at addressing inequality, the overall trend in many regions points toward a persistent gap between the wealthy and the poor. Therefore, I mostly agree with the statement, acknowledging that this perspective might not hold universally or in every context but is valid in many situations.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe that economic inequality has been increasing over time, with wealth accumulating among the very rich, while the economic situation of the poor tends to decline or remain stagnant. This perception is influenced by observed disparities in income, access to resources, and opportunities, which suggest that the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen.

This perception is supported by data showing growing income gaps and the accumulation of wealth among the rich, leading to a feeling that the wealth gap is widening. Consequently, I mostly agree that the rich just get richer while the poor get poorer, acknowledging that this may not be universally true in all contexts but reflects a broad trend in many regions.\n\nANSWER: B",
