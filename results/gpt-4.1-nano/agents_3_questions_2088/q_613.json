        "raw_output": "I am not personally responding to the survey, but if I were to consider public opinion, I would analyze the general perception of the PRI in recent years. The PRI, or Institutional Revolutionary Party, has historically been a dominant force in Mexican politics, but in recent times, it has faced criticism for corruption scandals and authoritarian practices. Many citizens might view the party with skepticism or distrust, leading to unfavorable opinions. However, some might still hold favorable views due to historical ties or specific policy support. Overall, considering the current political climate and public discourse, I would expect most people to have a somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion. Therefore, I would lean towards the less favorable options in the absence of specific data.\n\nANSWER: D",
