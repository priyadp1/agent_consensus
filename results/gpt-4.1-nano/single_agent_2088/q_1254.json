  "options": [
    "Approve",
    "Disapprove"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe President Obama\u2019s response to ISIS has been a mix of necessary action and challenges. His administration took steps to lead an international coalition, conduct airstrikes, and prevent the expansion of ISIS, which showed commitment and strategic effort. However, critics argue that there were shortcomings in early intelligence or troop deployment strategies that could have led to a more decisive victory sooner. Given the complexity of the situation and the mixed outcomes, my perspective leans toward disapproval of the overall handling, as I feel the response did not fully achieve the desired stability and security in the region.\n\nANSWER: B",
