    "Enough"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe Arab countries are doing too little to support the Palestinian people's goal of achieving statehood. While many Arab nations have expressed solidarity and provided aid, their efforts often fall short of what is needed to fully back Palestinian aspirations and address ongoing challenges.
