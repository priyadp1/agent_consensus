        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that drone attacks that result in the death of innocent people are problematic because they cause unnecessary harm and can undermine moral and ethical standards. Additionally, killing innocent civilians can lead to increased resentment and hostility, potentially fueling more conflict rather than resolving it.

On the other hand, the risk of causing civilian casualties raises serious ethical and humanitarian concerns. While security is important, I think ensuring the safety of innocent people should be a top priority, and therefore I believe measures should be taken to minimize these unintended deaths. \n\nANSWER: B",

Innocent casualties not only cause moral and ethical concerns but can also lead to greater hostility and conflict, undermining long-term peace efforts.

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I agree that drone attacks kill too many innocent people because, despite their tactical advantages, reports and investigations have shown repeated instances of civilian casualties. This often leads to humanitarian concerns and questions about the morality of such operations. Protecting innocent lives should be a priority, and if drone strikes cause significant unintended harm, their use needs to be critically reassessed and improved to prevent unnecessary suffering.\n\nANSWER: A",
