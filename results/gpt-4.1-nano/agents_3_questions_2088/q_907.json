For some, the conflict may have highlighted leadership strengths or resilience, increasing confidence. For others, it could have exposed vulnerabilities, inconsistencies, or questionable decisions, leading to decreased trust.

Given the complex and often polarized reactions to war, many individuals tend to feel less confident in the US's trustworthiness because of international conflicts, diplomatic disputes, or military actions that may be viewed skeptically.
