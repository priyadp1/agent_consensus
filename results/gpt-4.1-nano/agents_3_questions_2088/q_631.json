        "raw_output": "The question asks for a subjective assessment of who has a better life in the country\u2014men or women\u2014considering all factors involved. In general, societal conditions can influence perceptions of quality of life, including opportunities, safety, economic stability, and personal well-being. However, studies and social indicators often show that women face unique challenges such as gender inequality, limited access to certain resources, and gender-based violence which may impact their overall life satisfaction. Conversely, men may experience advantages in certain areas such as higher average income or societal privileges, but also face pressures and expectations that can negatively affect their well-being. Given the complex nature and the myriad factors influencing this perception, many people might see these differences as balancing out or view it as a nuanced issue. Because I am providing a subjective opinion in a broad societal context, I lean toward the idea that, on average, men tend to report or are perceived to have somewhat better life conditions than women due to systemic advantages, even though individual experiences vary widely.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "The question is subjective and depends on various factors like economic opportunity, social stability, safety, and personal fulfillment. Historically and statistically, men tend to have higher income levels, better employment rates, and more authoritative positions, which can contribute to a perception of having a better life. However, women often face challenges related to gender inequality, safety concerns, and work-life balance, which can negatively affect their overall well-being. Given these considerations, and acknowledging that perceptions can vary, many might believe men have a somewhat better quality of life overall, though this is not universal. Therefore, considering societal patterns and common perceptions, men are often viewed as having a better life in this country.\n\nANSWER: A",

Women, on the other hand, often face challenges related to gender inequality, including wage gaps, underrepresentation in leadership roles, and societal expectations. While women have made significant gains in education and participation in the workforce, disparities in health, safety, and economic security can impact their overall life experiences. Considering these factors, men generally have a comparatively better life in this country.\n\nANSWER: A",
