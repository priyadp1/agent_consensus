  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Both China and Japan are crucial economic partners for the United States, but countries generally prioritize relationships based on strategic importance, economic size, and political considerations. While China is a major trading partner and has significant influence in global supply chains, concerns over economic practices and geopolitical tensions often complicate the relationship. Japan, on the other hand, is a longstanding ally with a strong, stable economy, and serves as a key partner in regional security and technological innovation. Given the current geopolitical landscape, fostering strong economic ties with Japan may be more beneficial for stability and mutual growth, though maintaining healthy relations with China remains important for global economic health. Therefore, prioritizing strong economic ties with Japan aligns best with promoting a balanced and resilient international economic environment.\n\nANSWER: B",
