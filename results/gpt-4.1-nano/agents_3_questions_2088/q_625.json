        "raw_output": "The United Kingdom's role in global politics, economics, and diplomacy has evolved over the past decade. While it maintains significant influence, particularly through its historical connections and participation in international organizations, its relative power compared to other emerging nations has diminished somewhat. Brexit has also altered its global standing, both challenges and opportunities. Overall, the UK remains a key player but might have a slightly less prominent role on the world stage than it did ten years ago.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The United Kingdom has historically played a significant role in global politics, economics, and culture. Over the past decade, its influence has faced challenges such as Brexit, which has reshaped its international relationships and economic stance. While it remains an important player, some might argue its overall influence has diminished slightly compared to 10 years ago, especially as other emerging powers have gained prominence. However, its historical ties, military presence, and cultural impact still contribute to its importance on the world stage. Therefore, its role is perhaps somewhat less prominent now than it was a decade ago, but it still retains considerable significance. \n\nANSWER: B",

While some might argue that its relative influence has waned compared to emerging powers, the UK still holds significant geopolitical and cultural importance. Therefore, I believe that the UK's role is about as important as it was 10 years ago, balancing its longstanding influence with contemporary shifts in global power dynamics.\n\nANSWER: C",
