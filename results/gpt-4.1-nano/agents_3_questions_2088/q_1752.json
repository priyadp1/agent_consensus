        "raw_output": "I believe that economic problems in Europe can pose at least a minor threat to our country's economic well-being because Europe is a major economic partner for us through trade, investments, and financial markets. Instability or downturns in Europe can lead to disruptions in supply chains, decreased demand for exports, and increased financial uncertainty that may ripple into our economy. While the threat isn't necessarily catastrophic, it is significant enough to warrant concern and attention from policymakers and business leaders. Therefore, I would classify the threat as minor, acknowledging that it could become more severe if European issues escalate.\n\nANSWER: B",

Europe is a significant player in global markets, and any economic instability there might lead to disruptions in trade, investment, and financial markets worldwide. However, my country is somewhat resilient and has diversified its economy, so I do not see it as a major threat. Therefore, I see it as a concern that warrants attention but not alarm.\n\nANSWER: B",

A significant downturn in Europe could lead to reduced exports, financial instability, or disruptions in supply chains, which would affect our economy. Therefore, I think these issues pose at least a minor threat, and depending on the severity, possibly a major threat. Given the importance of Europe in our economic activities, I consider it a major concern.\n\nANSWER: A",

While Europe plays a significant role in global trade, finance, and investment, my country has taken steps to diversify its economy and reduce over-reliance on European markets.
