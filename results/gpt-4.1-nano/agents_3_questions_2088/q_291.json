        "raw_output": "The influence of media such as television, radio, newspapers, and magazines on the country's development can be quite complex. In many cases, media outlets provide essential information, promote awareness, and serve as a watchdog against corruption and injustice, which can be seen as a very good influence. However, in some contexts, media might spread misinformation, sensationalism, or biased narratives that could mislead the public or polarize society, leading to a somewhat bad influence. Overall, the impact largely depends on the media landscape's health, regulation, and the diversity of perspectives available. Given the importance of media as a tool for education, accountability, and civic engagement, I believe that in my country, the influence of media tends toward being somewhat good, as it generally contributes positively but is not without issues.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception, disseminating information, and influencing cultural norms. The overall impact of media can be positive when it promotes awareness, education, and healthy discourse, but it can also be negative if it spreads misinformation, sensationalism, or bias. In many countries, media channels have been criticized for propagating certain political agendas or amplifying trivial content, which can distort public understanding and contribute to social divisions. Considering these factors, I believe the influence of media is somewhat bad in my country, as the negative effects often outweigh the positive, and the media landscape is riddled with issues that impact the society adversely.\n\nANSWER: C",
