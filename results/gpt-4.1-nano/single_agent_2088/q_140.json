  "raw_output": "Large foreign companies can bring both positive and negative effects to our country. On the one hand, they may create jobs, introduce new technologies, and boost economic growth, which can be beneficial for our development. On the other hand, they might also lead to the loss of local businesses, reduce national control over key industries, or prioritize profits over social or environmental concerns. Overall, given the mixed impacts and the potential for negative consequences, I believe their influence leans more towards being problematic rather than beneficial. Therefore, I see their influence as somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C"
