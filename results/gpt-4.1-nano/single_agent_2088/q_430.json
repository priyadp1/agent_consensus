    "Result of efforts by Western powers",
    "Result of Russian dissatisfaction"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the protests are primarily a reflection of genuine Russian dissatisfaction with the conduct of the elections. While external influences can sometimes play a role in political events, the core motivations for many protesters seem to stem from concerns over electoral integrity and democratic processes within Russia. The visible participation and vocal demands for fair treatment suggest that these protests are rooted in domestic issues rather than solely in foreign attempts at destabilization.\n\nANSWER: B"
