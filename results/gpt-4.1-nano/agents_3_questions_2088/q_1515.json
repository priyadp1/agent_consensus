        "raw_output": "Political and parliamentary deadlock can significantly hinder a country's progress by stalling important legislation, delaying policy implementation, and increasing public frustration with governance. When governments are gridlocked, it often leads to a lack of effective decision-making, which can exacerbate other issues like economic instability and social unrest. While some may argue that deadlock is a common part of democratic processes, its persistence and impact can make it feel like a major obstacle to national development and stability. Therefore, I consider it a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Political and parliamentary deadlock can significantly hinder a country's ability to pass necessary legislation, respond effectively to crises, and implement reforms. When governments are stuck in gridlock, it often leads to frustration among citizens, delays progress on critical issues like economic development or social justice, and can weaken democratic institutions. While some might see it as a manageable obstacle, for many, persistent deadlock represents a serious barrier to national stability and growth, making it a very big problem. \n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Political and parliamentary deadlock can significantly hinder a country's ability to pass necessary legislation, implement policy changes, and respond effectively to urgent issues. When governments are unable to reach consensus, it can lead to stagnation and frustration among citizens. While it might not be as immediate a crisis as economic collapse or security threats, persistent deadlock can undermine democratic processes and weaken public trust in institutions. Therefore, I believe it is a moderately big problem that warrants attention but may not be the most urgent crisis facing the country.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe political and parliamentary deadlock is a very significant issue because it directly hampers the government's ability to enact reforms, respond to crises, and maintain stability. When political processes are gridlocked, it often leads to frustration, delays in addressing critical problems, and can undermine trust in democratic institutions. This kind of persistent stagnation can have long-term negative effects on a country's progress and governance, making it a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

Persistent deadlock often prevents the implementation of critical reforms and can lead to instability in both the political system and society at large.
