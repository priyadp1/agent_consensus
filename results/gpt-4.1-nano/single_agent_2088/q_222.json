  "question": "Who do you think is mostly to blame for this (that relations between Muslims and people in Western countries are generally bad), Muslims or people in Western countries?",
  "options": [
    "Muslims",
    "People in Western countries/Christians",
    "Jews (VOL)",
    "Both (VOL)",
    "Neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "I believe that relations between Muslims and people in Western countries are complicated by a combination of factors on both sides. Misunderstandings, stereotypes, political conflicts, and media representations often contribute to tensions. Assigning blame solely to Muslims or Westerners oversimplifies the issue. Instead, it seems that a shared responsibility exists, and fostering mutual understanding and dialogue could help improve relations. Therefore, I think both sides play a role. \n\nANSWER: D"
