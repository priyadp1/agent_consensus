        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "If Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, there remains concern that they might be willing to transfer such weapons or material to terrorist organizations, considering regional and ideological tensions. Historically, Iran's support for certain proxy groups suggests they could consider such actions as strategic leverage. However, the likelihood also depends on international pressures and diplomatic consequences. Given these complexities, it is plausible to believe that Iran might, under certain circumstances, be willing to provide nuclear weapons to terrorist groups.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The concern about Iran providing nuclear weapons to terrorist organizations stems from the complex geopolitical dynamics and regional stability issues in the Middle East. Historically, Iran has maintained an adversarial stance toward some Western nations and Israel, and has been accused of supporting various proxies and militant groups. If Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, some analysts might worry that it could attempt to use these as leverage or spread nuclear proliferation by supplying them to non-state actors or terrorist groups. However, the likelihood of Iran intentionally providing nuclear weapons directly to terrorist organizations depends on many strategic and ethical considerations, including the potential international backlash and the risk of nuclear escalation. Given these factors, it is generally considered improbable that Iran would openly share nuclear weapons with terrorist groups, though indirect support or proliferation concerns remain.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "If Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, there is concern among some observers that the country might be more inclined to share or transfer these weapons to terrorist organizations, given its history of supporting non-state actors in the region. This possibility could stem from Iran's strategic interests to extend its influence and undermine adversaries through proxy groups, rather than through direct conflict. However, such an action would likely carry significant international repercussions, making it uncertain whether Iran would risk such a move. Considering these factors, I believe that the likelihood is high enough to warrant concern, but not certainty.\n\nANSWER: A",

However, the possibility of indirect support or transfer remains a concern, especially if Iran's strategic interests are threatened. Given the uncertainty and the potential for clandestine actions, I believe that it is not likely that Iran would willingly provide nuclear weapons to terrorist groups.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Given the historical context of Iran's support for proxy groups and the strategic use of asymmetric tactics, there is a credible concern that Iran might consider providing nuclear materials or weapons to terrorist organizations as a form of strategic leverage. While openly supplying nuclear weapons to non-state actors would carry enormous risks and international repercussions, the possibility of indirect transfer or support remains a worry among many analysts. Considering these factors, I believe it is more likely than not that Iran could, under certain circumstances, provide nuclear weapons or related material to terrorist groups.\n\nANSWER: A",
