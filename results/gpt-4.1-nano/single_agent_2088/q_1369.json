  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that Russia's support of the Syrian government is a complex issue with both geopolitical and humanitarian implications. On one hand, Russia claims to support stability and counter-terrorism efforts in Syria, which can be seen as providing regional security. On the other hand, their involvement has been associated with exacerbating conflict and civilian suffering. Considering these aspects, I tend to oppose foreign military support that leads to increased violence and humanitarian issues.\n\nANSWER: B",
