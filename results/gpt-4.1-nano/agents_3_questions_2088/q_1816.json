        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, the spread of diseases in our country has generally worsened, primarily due to the emergence of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, which led to widespread outbreaks and overwhelmed healthcare systems. While there have been improvements in disease prevention and vaccination efforts, the overall impact of these health crises highlights that the situation has not improved and, in some cases, has deteriorated, especially in terms of controlling the rapid spread of illnesses during global health emergencies.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, the spread of diseases has generally worsened in many countries, partly due to the emergence of new infectious agents like COVID-19, global travel increasing the spread of illnesses, and variations in healthcare access and vaccination coverage. While some regions have made improvements through better public health measures, overall, the world has experienced significant challenges in controlling disease outbreaks, leading to an overall perception that the situation has deteriorated rather than improved.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "In the last five years, the spread of diseases has generally worsened, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a global health crisis and highlighted vulnerabilities in disease prevention and control measures. While some regions have improved their healthcare responses, the overall proliferation and unpredictable nature of new infectious diseases suggest that, on a national scale, the situation has not improved and may have become more challenging. Consequently, the evidence points to a worsening trend in the spread of diseases over this period.\n\nANSWER: B",

Despite some improvements in certain regions, the overall difficulty in controlling infectious diseases and the increased frequency of pandemics suggest that the situation has deteriorated rather than improved. Therefore, I believe the spread has gotten worse in our country during this period. \n\nANSWER: B",

Although there have been advancements in vaccination and public health responses, these efforts have not fully contained the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Overall, the situation appears to have worsened rather than improved in terms of controlling disease transmission at the national level.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there have been advances in vaccination, public health infrastructure, and awareness, these efforts have not completely contained or reduced the spread of infectious diseases nationally. The challenges posed by new variants, waves of infections, and strained healthcare systems suggest that the situation has, on balance, worsened in terms of controlling disease transmission.\n\nANSWER: B",
