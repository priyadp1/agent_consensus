  "question": "And how good a job is British Prime Minister David Cameron doing in dealing with the European economic crisis? Is British Prime Minister David Cameron doing a very good job, a somewhat good job, a somewhat bad job or a very bad job? ",
  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Considering the intricate nature of the European economic crisis and the limited direct control of the UK government over EU-wide economic policies, Prime Minister David Cameron's role was largely reactive rather than proactive. While he may have taken steps to protect British interests, many would argue that the overall impact was modest and that the UK struggled to significantly influence the resolution or mitigation of the crisis. Therefore, I believe he did not do a very good job in dealing with this complex issue.\n\nANSWER: C",
