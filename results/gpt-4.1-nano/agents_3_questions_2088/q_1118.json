        "raw_output": "I believe that we should maintain our current level of immigration to ensure a balanced approach that benefits both our economy and social cohesion. Allowing more immigrants could boost diversity and fill labor shortages, but it might also strain resources if not managed properly. Conversely, reducing immigration could impact growth and cultural richness. Therefore, staying with the current level seems most prudent to manage these factors effectively.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe that immigration policies should be balanced to support economic growth and cultural diversity, so I think we should allow more immigrants to move to our country. By welcoming additional immigrants, we can fill labor shortages, foster innovation, and enrich our society's cultural fabric, provided that proper integration measures are in place. It is important, however, to manage the process responsibly and ensure that infrastructure and social services can accommodate the increase. Therefore, I support allowing more immigrants rather than maintaining the current level or reducing it significantly.\n\nANSWER: A",

This approach allows us to support economic growth and cultural diversity without overwhelming social services or infrastructure. It provides stability while still welcoming newcomers who can contribute positively to society. Given the considerations, staying at the current level seems most reasonable to manage resources effectively and promote social cohesion.\n\nANSWER: C",
