        "raw_output": "My understanding is that societal attitudes in Russia are diverse, and while there is some hostility towards Muslims, particularly in certain regions or among specific groups, it is not representative of the entire population. The perception of hostility varies widely, but it is unlikely that most Russians hold hostile views toward Muslims. Instead, it might be more accurate to say that only some individuals harbor negative sentiments, with many being neutral or tolerant. This balanced view suggests that hostility is not widespread but exists among a segment of the population.\n\nANSWER: C",
