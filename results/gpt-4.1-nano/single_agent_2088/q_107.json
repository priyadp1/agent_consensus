  "question": "What's your impression, does the Church play too great a role in the political life of this country today, too small a role in its political life or about the right role?",
  "options": [
    "Too great",
    "Too small",
    "About right",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the Church currently influences political life to a degree that can sometimes be disproportionate, especially when it intersects with issues that deeply concern public policy and individual rights. While religious organizations can contribute positively to moral debates, their extensive involvement might overshadow secular governance and dilute the principles of separation of church and state. Therefore, I think their role is somewhat excessive relative to the secular nature of modern governance.\n\nANSWER: A"
