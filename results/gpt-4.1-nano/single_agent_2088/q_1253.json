  "question": "Do you think Pakistani influence in Afghanistan is a very big problem for India, a moderately big problem, a small problem or not a problem at all?",
  "options": [
    "Very big problem",
    "Moderately big problem",
    "Small problem",
    "Not a problem at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Pakistani influence in Afghanistan remains a significant concern for India, given the historical and strategic implications. Afghanistan's proximity and Pakistan's involvement in regional dynamics can affect India's security, especially in terms of cross-border terrorism and stability. While the issue is important, it is somewhat less immediate than other pressing security challenges India faces, making it a moderately big problem rather than the most critical threat. Therefore, I consider it a moderately big problem.\n\nANSWER: B",
