While some parts may function well, overall reform is necessary to address issues like corruption, representation disparities, and partisanship.

While some structures work well, there is significant room for improvement to increase transparency, accountability, and responsiveness. Complete reform might be too drastic at this point, but substantial changes are necessary to restore public trust and ensure the system serves everyone's interests effectively.\n\nANSWER: B",

These issues prevent the system from effectively representing the will of the people and eroding public trust. While some structures function, significant reforms are necessary to improve transparency, responsiveness, and overall effectiveness instead of insisting on a complete overhaul.
