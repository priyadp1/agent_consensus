        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "My expectation is that relations may become somewhat strained or less predictable due to the unpredictable nature of Donald Trump's approach to diplomacy and international relations. Given his previous policies and rhetoric, there is a concern that cooperation might decrease, or tensions could increase, leading to deteriorating relations.

Additionally, given past tensions and disagreements, it is likely that relations could face further strain during Trump's presidency. However, some may argue that efforts could be made to improve cooperation, but overall, skepticism persists. Therefore, I think the most probable outcome is that relations will get worse.\n\nANSWER: B",
