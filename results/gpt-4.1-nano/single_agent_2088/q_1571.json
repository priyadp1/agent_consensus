  "question": "Do you think the European Union is a world power?",
  "options": [
    "Yes",
    "No"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The European Union wields significant economic and political influence globally, with major institutions like the European Commission and Parliament shaping policies and international relations. Its large combined GDP and ability to project diplomatic power suggest it functions as a major player on the world stage. However, it lacks a unified military force comparable to other global powers, and its member states retain significant sovereignty, which limits collective global influence. Considering these factors, while the EU is undoubtedly influential economically and diplomatically, it may not fully meet the traditional criteria of a \"world power\" like the United States or China. Therefore, I believe the EU is a significant regional and economic power but not a comprehensive world power in the traditional sense.\n\nANSWER: B",
