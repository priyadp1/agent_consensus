        "raw_output": "The influence of the military in my country has historically been complex. While the military has often contributed to maintaining stability and national security, its involvement in political and civilian affairs has sometimes led to restrictions on democratic processes and human rights. Depending on recent developments, some people perceive the military's role as stabilizing, whereas others see it as a hindrance to progress and civil freedoms. Overall, the perception leans more toward a negative impact rather than a positive one, given concerns about authoritarian tendencies and limited civilian oversight.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The influence of the military in my country is a complex issue. In some cases, the military has played a stabilizing role during times of crisis, helping to restore order and maintain national security. However, in many instances, their involvement has also led to increased repression, suppression of political freedoms, and undermining democratic institutions. Overall, the military's influence tends to cause more concern than reassurance, often contributing to instability rather than peace. Based on these considerations, I believe their impact is more damaging than beneficial.\n\nANSWER: D",

While the military can contribute to stability and security, in my context, their involvement has often led to political instability, suppression of dissent, and restrictions on civil liberties. This has hindered democratic development and affected the overall progress of the country negatively. Therefore, I see their influence as more harmful than helpful in shaping positive developments.\n\nANSWER: C",
