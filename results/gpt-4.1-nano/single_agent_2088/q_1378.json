  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that whether there is a conflict depends on individual interpretation of religious teachings and societal norms. Many Christians find ways to adapt their faith to modern contexts without compromising core beliefs, fostering harmony between their spirituality and social life. Others may perceive certain societal values or practices as conflicting with their religious principles, which can create internal or external tensions. Therefore, I think the existence of this conflict is not universal but varies from person to person.\n\nANSWER: B",
