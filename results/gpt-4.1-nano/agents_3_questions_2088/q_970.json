        "raw_output": "The statement addresses the protection of free speech and the right to express views publicly, which can vary significantly depending on the country. In some countries, these rights are strongly protected and enshrined in law, allowing people to speak openly without fear of suppression or punishment. In others, censorship, government control, or social pressure may limit these rights, making the statement less accurate. Considering the diversity of global contexts and assuming a general assessment, many countries still face challenges in fully safeguarding public expression rights. Therefore, I would say the statement describes my country somewhat well, acknowledging that protections exist but may not be comprehensive or fully upheld across all regions or communities.\n\nANSWER: B",

However, in practice, these rights can sometimes be limited by government actions, censorship, or social pressures, especially in situations related to political dissent or controversial topics. Overall, I believe that the rights are protected but not always fully upheld in reality, leading to some restrictions or self-censorship.

Given that in most countries these rights are protected to some extent but are often subject to limitations or social pressures, I believe my country falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.
