        "raw_output": "The question addresses the complex issue of integration and cultural identity among Muslims in the country. Since individuals\u2019 attitudes can vary widely based on personal beliefs, cultural background, and community influences, it is unlikely that most Muslims uniformly want to adopt the dominant customs or maintain a distinct identity. The most accurate reflection is that some may seek integration while others prefer to preserve their traditions, which is why choosing the option that recognizes both perspectives is appropriate. This nuanced view acknowledges the diversity within the Muslim community without making broad assumptions.\n\nANSWER: C",

Some may seek to adopt more of the dominant customs to integrate fully into society, while others may prefer maintaining their distinct cultural and religious practices. Given this diversity, it is likely that there is no single prevailing attitude, and many may hold a mix of both views. Therefore, I choose the option that reflects this diversity.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "This question involves generalizations about the desires of a large and diverse group, which makes it inherently complex. People's preferences among accommodating or maintaining distinct cultural identities vary widely based on individual experiences, community influences, and socio-political factors. Because of this variability, it is difficult to confidently assert a majority perspective. Some members may seek integration and adopt local customs, while others may prioritize preserving distinct cultural or religious identities. Given the complexity and the potential lack of comprehensive data, the most appropriate response would be that these are both valid perspectives depending on individual circumstances and subgroup differences.\n\nANSWER: C",
