  "options": [
    "Favor",
    "Oppose"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I oppose stoning people who commit adultery because such punishment is extremely harsh and violates principles of human rights and dignity.

As such, I believe that alternative methods focusing on rehabilitation and counseling are more appropriate for addressing adultery. \n\nANSWER: B"
