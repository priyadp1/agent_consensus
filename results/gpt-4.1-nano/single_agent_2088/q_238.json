  "question": "Now thinking about German trade with particular countries. Do you think increased trade with Russia would be a very good thing, somewhat good, somewhat bad or a very bad thing for our country?",
  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Increased trade with Russia could enhance economic ties, energy supply, and strategic partnerships, which might be beneficial for Germany. However, considering recent geopolitical issues, sanctions, and conflicts, expanding trade might also entrench dependencies or conflict with international values. On balance, the potential economic and strategic benefits seem to outweigh the negatives, assuming proper safeguards are in place. Therefore, it could be seen as a somewhat good development for our country.\n\nANSWER: B"
