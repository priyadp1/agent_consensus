  "options": [
    "Support",
    "Oppose"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe allowing foreign investment in Pemex can bring in much-needed capital, technology, and expertise that can help modernize and increase the efficiency of Mexico's energy sector. This can potentially lead to economic growth, job creation, and more competitive energy prices for consumers. However, it is essential that such investments are carefully regulated to ensure national interests and sovereignty are protected, and that Pemex\u2019s role as a national resource remains secure. Overall, I support opening up to foreign investments with appropriate safeguards in place.\n\nANSWER: A"
