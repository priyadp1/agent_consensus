        "raw_output": "I consider public debt to be a very big problem because high levels of public debt can lead to economic instability, reduce a country's ability to invest in essential services, and increase the risk of financial crises. When debt becomes unmanageable, it can burden future generations and limit government policies to respond to economic challenges effectively.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Public debt can be a significant concern because high levels may impair a country's ability to fund important services, lead to higher taxes, or result in economic instability. When debt becomes excessive, it can limit future policy options and increase financial vulnerability. However, if current debt levels are manageable and used productively, it might not pose an immediate severe problem. Overall, for many countries, public debt remains a serious issue that needs careful management. \n\nANSWER: A",

In many countries, substantial public debt can hinder growth and burden future generations. Therefore, I see it as a very big problem, especially if the debt levels are unsustainable or growing rapidly.\n\nANSWER: A",
