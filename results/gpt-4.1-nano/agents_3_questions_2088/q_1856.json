        "raw_output": "Many average Nigerians do not feel they are benefiting from the country's oil wealth due to widespread poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to basic amenities despite Nigeria's significant oil production. The wealth generated often remains concentrated among a few elites and corrupt officials, leaving the general population marginalized and impoverished. This disparity leads to a perception that the common people do not truly benefit from the country\u2019s natural resources. \n\nANSWER: B",

The wealth generated often remains concentrated among a few elites and multinational companies, leaving average citizens with limited improvements in their standard of living. Despite Nigeria's vast oil reserves, the majority of the population continues to face challenges such as unemployment, inadequate public services, and environmental degradation caused by oil exploration.

While Nigeria is one of Africa's largest producers of oil, the wealth generated often remains concentrated among a small elite or is mismanaged through corruption. The majority of average people continue to face issues like poverty, poor infrastructure, and limited access to quality education and healthcare, which indicates that they are not truly benefiting from the country's resource wealth.
