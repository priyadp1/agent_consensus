    "Bad"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the trend toward a global economy is beneficial for our country because it can lead to increased trade opportunities, access to a wider range of products and services, and the potential for economic growth. Engaging more with the global market can also attract foreign investment and create new jobs, which can improve living standards. However, it is important to manage this integration carefully to protect local industries and ensure that economic gains are shared broadly. Overall, the advantages of a more connected global economy outweigh the potential drawbacks.\nANSWER: A"
