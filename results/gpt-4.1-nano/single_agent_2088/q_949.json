  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that women should have the fundamental right to make personal decisions about their attire, including whether to wear a veil. Wearing a veil can be a matter of cultural identity, religious belief, or personal choice. Respecting individual autonomy means supporting women's rights to decide what they wear without coercion or restriction. Ensuring this freedom promotes gender equality and respects personal liberty. Therefore, I fully support women's right to decide on wearing a veil.\n\nANSWER: A",
