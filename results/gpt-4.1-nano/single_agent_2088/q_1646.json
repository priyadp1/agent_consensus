  "question": "I'd like your opinion about the effectiveness of different ways of trying to influence what the government does. How effective is it to...attend a political campaign event or speech...very effective, somewhat effective, not too effective, or not at all effective?",
  "options": [
    "Very effective",
    "Somewhat effective",
    "Not too effective",
    "Not at all effective"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Attending a political campaign event or speech can be somewhat effective in influencing government actions because it allows individuals to show support, raise awareness, and potentially persuade others. However, on its own, it may not directly lead to significant policy changes, especially if not combined with other forms of civic engagement like voting or lobbying. Therefore, I believe it is somewhat effective.\n\nANSWER: B",
