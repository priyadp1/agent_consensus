  "question": "As I read some policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, please tell me if you approve or disapprove of each one. e. U.S. increasing tariffs or fees on imported goods from other countries",
  "options": [
    "Approve",
    "Disapprove",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Increasing tariffs or fees on imported goods can protect domestic industries and potentially boost the economy by encouraging consumers to buy local. However, it also risks provoking trade retaliation, raising costs for consumers and businesses that rely on imported goods, and possibly triggering trade wars. Given these mixed implications, opinions vary widely. Personally, I recognize both the potential benefits and downsides, but as a general stance, I am cautious about promoting tariffs that might harm international relations and consumer interests. Therefore, I tend to disapprove of such policy measures, considering their broader economic and diplomatic impacts.\n\nANSWER: B"
