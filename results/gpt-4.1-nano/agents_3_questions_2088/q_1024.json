        "raw_output": "I believe that both the United States and Mexico share responsibility for the drug violence issues. The U.S. has contributed through high demand for illegal drugs and involvement of American-based gangs, which fuels the drug trade. Meanwhile, Mexico faces challenges related to corruption, organized crime, and insufficient law enforcement capacity that enable violence to persist. Therefore, accountability lies with both countries, as their interconnected roles create a complex problem that cannot be solely attributed to one side.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "The issue of drug violence in Mexico is complex and influenced by multiple factors. The United States' role in demand for illegal drugs, along with American trafficking routes and related money flows, significantly contribute to the violence. At the same time, Mexico bears responsibility for its domestic policies, law enforcement effectiveness, and corruption levels, which can exacerbate the violence. Recognizing the interconnectedness of these factors, it seems most reasonable to attribute some blame to both parties rather than focusing solely on one. This perspective encourages understanding of the shared responsibilities and emphasizes the need for cooperation to address the problem effectively.\n\nANSWER: C",

The U.S. has played a significant role by demanding illegal drugs, which fuels the drug trade, and contributing to high levels of drug consumption. Meanwhile, Mexico bears responsibility for the ongoing violence related to drug trafficking organizations and enforcement efforts. Blaming one side overlooks the complex, interconnected factors driving the violence, so recognizing shared blame seems the most accurate reflection of the situation.\n\nANSWER: C",
