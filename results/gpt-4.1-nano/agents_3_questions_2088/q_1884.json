While there are efforts to uphold safety and enforce laws, there are also ongoing issues with crime and justice that prevent it from being considered very well maintained.

While the core institutions function and provide a level of safety, occasional incidents or lapses in enforcement suggest that the situation is not perfect.

While many law enforcement agencies work diligently to keep citizens safe, issues like violence, crime rates, and inconsistent enforcement suggest that we do not fully maintain law and order at the highest standards. Therefore, my view is that it is not quite very well, but it is not entirely failing either.\n\nANSWER: B",
