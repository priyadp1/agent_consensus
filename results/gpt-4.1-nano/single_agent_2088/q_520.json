  "options": [
    "Very big problem",
    "Moderately big problem",

  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "The conflict between religious groups can vary greatly depending on the country and context. In some places, it may lead to violence, social division, and undermine national stability, making it a very big problem. In other contexts, it might be a manageable issue or not a major concern, perhaps only a small matter or not at all problematic. Overall, given the potential for significant unrest and societal harm that such conflicts can cause, I believe it tends to be a very big problem in many countries. \n\nANSWER: A"
