  "options": [
    "Favor",
    "Oppose"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Turkey has been a longstanding applicant to the European Union, and its accession could potentially strengthen economic and geopolitical ties between Europe and the Middle East. However, challenges related to political reform, human rights concerns, and the country's compliance with EU accession criteria have raised doubts over the feasibility of Turkey joining within the next decade. Considering these factors, I support opposing Turkey's immediate accession to prioritize the EU's standards and principles.\n\nANSWER: B"
