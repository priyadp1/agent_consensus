        "raw_output": "Allowing fewer immigrants into the U.S. can be viewed from different perspectives. Supporters might argue it helps protect American jobs, national security, and social resources, aligning with concerns about immigration control. Conversely, opponents may see it as exclusionary, potentially harming the country's diversity and standing as a welcoming nation. My personal view aligns with valuing a balanced approach that considers economic needs and humanitarian principles, but I understand the complexities involved. Given the options, I lean toward supporting measures that ensure immigration policies are fair and well-regulated while respecting human rights. Therefore, I approve of restricting immigration to some extent but advocate for humane policies.\n\nANSWER: A",
