Overall, there are areas of constructive dialogue and cooperation, but also tensions and misunderstandings fueled by geopolitical conflicts, media narratives, and social issues. Given this complexity, it is reasonable to view the relations as mixed, but leaning towards negative perceptions due to ongoing conflicts and incidents that often dominate headlines.
