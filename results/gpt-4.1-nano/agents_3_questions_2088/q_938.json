        "raw_output": "In my opinion, international organizations such as the UN should have the final say in case of disagreements among countries regarding global environmental policies. This is because environmental issues are inherently global, transcending national borders and requiring collective action. International organizations are designed to mediate between nations, ensuring that decisions consider the interests of the global community and promote sustainable solutions. Relying solely on individual governments could lead to conflicting interests and inadequate measures, whereas a neutral international body can help enforce consensus and uphold global standards for environmental protection.\n\nANSWER: B",

This is because such organizations are specifically designed to facilitate cooperation among countries, establish globally accepted standards, and ensure that environmental protection efforts are unified and effective. Relying on an international body helps transcend individual national interests and promotes a collective approach to addressing global environmental challenges, which are inherently transnational issues that require coordinated action beyond national borders.\n\nANSWER: B",

This is because international organizations are designed to facilitate cooperation among nations and establish unified guidelines that transcend national interests. They can provide an impartial platform to mediate disagreements and create policies that prioritize the global good over individual countries' agendas. Relying on such organizations helps ensure that environmental protection efforts are consistent, credible, and rooted in international consensus, which is essential given the global nature of environmental issues. Trusting a single government might lead to policies driven by national interests rather than global sustainability. Therefore, giving the final authority to an international organization promotes fairness and effectiveness in protecting the environment worldwide.\n\nANSWER: B",
