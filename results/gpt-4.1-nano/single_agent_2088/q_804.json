    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "The local police in my country have a mixed reputation. While some police officers perform their duties professionally and contribute positively to community safety, there are also instances of corruption, abuse of power, and inadequate response to crime, which damages public trust and effectiveness. Overall, the influence tends to lean more towards being problematic rather than beneficial, affecting the country's stability and security negatively.\n\nANSWER: D"
