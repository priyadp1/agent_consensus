        "raw_output": "The court system's influence is often seen as a crucial factor in maintaining justice and legal order in a country. If the court system functions fairly, transparently, and efficiently, it can significantly contribute to stability and trust in government and society. However, if it is plagued by corruption, delays, or bias, it can undermine public confidence and lead to chaos or injustice. My current impression is that the court system's influence in my country is somewhat flawed, with notable deficiencies that hinder its effectiveness, though it has not entirely destroyed trust or stability. Therefore, I consider its influence to be somewhat bad.  \nANSWER: C",

While the courts are essential for justice, there are concerns about corruption, lack of independence, and inconsistent rulings that undermine public trust and the effective functioning of the justice system. These issues can slow down legal processes, erode confidence in the rule of law, and negatively impact social stability, which leads me to believe the influence is more towards the negative side rather than positive.\n\nANSWER: C",
