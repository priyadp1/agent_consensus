        "raw_output": "In the past decade, Egypt has experienced significant political and social changes, including the 2011 revolution and subsequent political instability. These events have heightened Egypt's regional profile, making its role in the Middle East more prominent, especially in terms of security, diplomacy, and regional stability.

        "raw_output": "In the past decade, Egypt has experienced significant political upheaval, including the 2011 revolution and subsequent changes in governance and stability. These developments have affected Egypt's regional influence and internal importance. While Egypt remains a key player in the Middle East due to its large population, strategic location, and historical significance, its level of influence has fluctuated because of internal challenges and shifting regional dynamics. Overall, it seems that Egypt's role is somewhat diminished compared to its previous prominence, but it still maintains notable regional importance. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Egypt plays a less important role in the Middle East today than it did 10 years ago.\n\nANSWER: B",

Over the past decade, its role has arguably become even more prominent because of its involvement in regional peace initiatives, economic development, and efforts to stabilize surrounding conflicts. Additionally, Egypt's strategic position and leadership within Arab and African organizations have kept its influence steady or increased. While internal challenges may have affected its capacity, on the whole, Egypt's importance in Middle Eastern affairs has maintained or grown compared to 10 years ago.\n\nANSWER: A",
