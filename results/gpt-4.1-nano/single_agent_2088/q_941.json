  "question": "Did the international dispute about the war in Iraq show that the United Nations still plays an important role in dealing with international conflicts or does it show that the United Nations is not so important any more?",
  "options": [
    "Still important",
    "Not so important",
    "No difference (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "The international dispute over the Iraq war highlighted both the strengths and limitations of the United Nations. While the UN provided a platform for debate and attempted to mediate tensions, many member states acted unilaterally or outside its framework, diminishing its perceived authority and efficacy. This suggests that the organization still holds importance as a diplomatic platform but may no longer be the primary decision-maker in major conflicts. Overall, the dispute demonstrates that the UN remains relevant but perhaps less influential than in the past.\n\nANSWER: A",
