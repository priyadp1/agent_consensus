Most Muslims are peaceful and oppose violence and terrorism, and support for extremist groups is generally limited to a very small minority within any population.

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Based on the available global data and general perceptions, it is widely understood that supporting extremism, especially violent acts associated with groups like al Qaeda, is not common among the majority of Muslims worldwide. While there are some individuals or small groups that may support or sympathize with such ideologies, the overwhelming majority reject extremism and violence, considering them contrary to mainstream Islamic teachings. Therefore, it is most accurate to categorize the support for Islamic extremists like al Qaeda among Muslims as just some or very few, rather than most or many. Given the answer options, \"just some\" seems to best reflect the broader and more accurate understanding of global Muslim populations' attitudes.\n\nANSWER: C",

Most Muslim communities tend to emphasize peace, coexistence, and reject violence. While a small minority might have sympathies or be influenced by extremist ideologies, it is not representative of the larger Muslim population.
