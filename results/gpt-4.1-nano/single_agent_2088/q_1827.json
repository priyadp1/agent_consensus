  "question": "If Iraq is disarmed and Saddam Hussein is removed from power by the U.S. and its allies, do you think the Middle East region will be more stable or less stable in the long run than it is now?",
  "options": [
    "More stable",
    "Less stable"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Removing Saddam Hussein and disarming Iraq could potentially lead to increased instability in the short term due to power vacuums, insurgency, and regional tensions. However, in the long run, it might reduce the risk of Saddam's regime fostering terrorism and suppressing dissent, possibly leading to greater stability if a stable government can be established. Given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding such a significant intervention, it is more plausible that the region would become less stable overall until peace and order are restored.\n\nANSWER: B",
