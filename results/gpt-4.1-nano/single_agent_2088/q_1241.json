  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I oppose making segregation of men and women in the workplace into law because it can reinforce gender stereotypes, limit opportunities for equality, and reduce diversity that benefits organizations and society as a whole. Ensuring equal treatment and integration promotes fairness, collaboration, and respect among all individuals. Institutionalizing segregation may also lead to discrimination and social division, undermining efforts toward gender equality. Therefore, I believe such a law would be detrimental to social progress and individual rights.\n\nANSWER: B",
