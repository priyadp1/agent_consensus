  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Foreign companies in the mining industry often bring in investments, advanced technology, and create employment opportunities, which can boost the country's economic activity. However, their contributions might be limited if profits are repatriated abroad or if they don't sufficiently benefit local communities. Given these mixed effects, I believe their contribution is moderate but not overwhelmingly significant. Therefore, I would select an option that reflects a positive yet not maximal contribution.\n\nANSWER: B",
