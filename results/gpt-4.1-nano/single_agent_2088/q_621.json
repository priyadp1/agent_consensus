  "question": "Overall, how much influence do you think Iran is having on the way things are going in your country? Would you say it is having a great deal of influence, a fair amount, not too much, or no influence at all? (Ask if 'A great deal' or 'A fair amount':) Is this a good thing, a bad thing, or neither good nor bad? ",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad",
    "Neither"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe Iran's influence on my country is relatively limited, and even if it were more significant, I see influence as a neutral factor that depends on the context. Having influence from any external country can be beneficial if it promotes stability, economic growth, or positive cultural exchange. Conversely, it could be problematic if it interferes with sovereignty or national values. Since the perception of influence can be complex and context-dependent, I think it's best not to categorize it simply as good or bad but rather as neither inherently good nor bad.\n\nANSWER: C"
