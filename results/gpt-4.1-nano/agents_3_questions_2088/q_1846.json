However, generally, these conflicts are more often strong but not necessarily very strong, as political disagreements can sometimes lead to heated debates or tensions. Still, they usually fall short of being extremely intense or violent. Therefore, I believe they are typically strong but not very strong. \n\nANSWER: B",

While some individuals may engage in respectful debate, the overall atmosphere can sometimes be hostile or confrontational, indicating that these conflicts are generally strong rather than mild or absent.
