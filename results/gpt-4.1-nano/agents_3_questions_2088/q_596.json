        "raw_output": "I believe China\u2019s economic impact on India is a somewhat serious problem because China is a major trade partner and regional influence can affect India's economic stability and strategic interests. While it is significant, India has also been working on diversifying its economy and strengthening other partnerships, which mitigates the level of seriousness. Therefore, I see it as important but not overwhelmingly critical at this moment. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The economic relationship between China and India is complex, but given China's significant role in global manufacturing, trade, and investment, its economic impact on India can influence employment, industry growth, and economic stability. While it can pose challenges to India's domestic industries and trade balance, India also benefits from robust economic ties, which can foster development and cooperation. Overall, I believe the impact is notable but not necessarily dire, making it a matter of concern that requires careful management rather than a catastrophic problem.\n\nANSWER: B",

While India is diversifying its economy and maintaining strong partnerships to mitigate this impact, reliance on China's economic activities still presents challenges that need careful management. Therefore, it is an issue of concern but not an immediate or severe crisis.\n\nANSWER: B",

While China is an important trade partner and contributor to regional stability, its influence also brings challenges such as competition and strategic concerns. The relationship has significant implications for India's economic policies and security considerations, but it is not an overwhelmingly critical issue requiring urgent overreaction. Therefore, I consider it to be a moderate concern that warrants attention but not an immediate threat beyond manageable levels.\n\nANSWER: B",
