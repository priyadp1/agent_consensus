        "raw_output": "The European Union is a significant global actor due to its large economy, influence in international trade, and ability to shape global standards through policies and diplomacy. While it may not have the same military dominance as superpowers like the United States or China, its economic and diplomatic weight often positions it as a key player in world affairs. However, its influence is somewhat decentralized, as it consists of multiple sovereign nations rather than a singular government. Considering these factors, it fits more as a regional power with substantial global influence rather than a traditional superpower. \n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "The European Union is a significant global player due to its economic size, political influence, and strategic partnerships. It has a major role in international trade, diplomacy, and setting regulatory standards worldwide. While it may not have the military power comparable to superpowers like the United States or China, its collective economic and diplomatic influence positions it as a prominent actor on the world stage. Therefore, considering its multifaceted power and influence, it is reasonable to see the EU as a world power.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I believe the European Union functions as a significant global actor through its economic influence, regulatory standards, diplomatic initiatives, and its role in international organizations. However, it does not possess the military power or unified foreign policy that traditionally characterizes a superpower. Its influence is substantial but primarily economic and diplomatic rather than military or geopolitical in the same sense as countries like the United States or China. Therefore, while the EU is influential on the world stage, it does not fully qualify as a world power in the traditional sense.\n\nANSWER: A",
