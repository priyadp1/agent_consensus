        "raw_output": "Based on the information available and recent developments, it is difficult to definitively assign responsibility for the missile strikes without concrete evidence. There are various regional actors and external parties who could be involved, and false flag or misattribution scenarios are also possible. Therefore, it is prudent to consider that these strikes could be the work of someone else entirely, perhaps a non-state actor or a third-party nation seeking to influence regional stability. \n\nANSWER: C",

      "1": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe the missile strikes are most likely being launched by someone else because there have been multiple conflicting reports and speculations about the responsible parties. While the Pakistani and U.S. governments have both denied involvement or attributed the strikes to other sources, the true origin remains uncertain and is often attributed to non-state actors or covert operations. This complexity makes it difficult to assign blame solely to either government, and the ambiguity suggests an alternative actor or a shared, indirect involvement. Therefore, I think the most plausible answer is someone else.\n\nANSWER: C",

      "2": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe that the missile strikes are likely being launched by someone else because there have been no official confirmations from either the Pakistani or U.S. governments, and such incidents often involve unidentified or third-party actors operating in the region. The complexity of geopolitical tensions and possible covert operations suggest it could be a third party or insurgent group rather than an official government action. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Given the existing responses which emphasize the ambiguity and the likelihood of third-party or non-state actors behind the missile strikes, I also believe that the responsible party is not clearly identifiable as the Pakistani or U.S. governments. The lack of official confirmation and conflicting reports point towards the involvement of someone else, possibly insurgent groups or covert operators operating in the region. Therefore, I am choosing the option that best aligns with this reasoning.\n\nANSWER: C",
