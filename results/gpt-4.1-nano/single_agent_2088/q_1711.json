  "question": "How much influence do you think China is having on the way things are going in our country? Would you say it is having a great deal of influence, a fair amount, not too much, or no influence at all?",
  "options": [
    "Great deal",
    "Fair amount",
    "Not too much",
    "No influence at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe China does have a notable influence on global economic and political trends, and this impact extends to a variety of countries, including ours. While it may not directly control all aspects of our nation's policies or decisions, China's growing economic power and strategic initiatives can shape international relations and market dynamics. Therefore, I think it has a fair amount of influence, but not a great deal enough to dominate or significantly alter our country's core decision-making processes.\n\nANSWER: B",
