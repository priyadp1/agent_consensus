  "question": "As I read a list of groups and organizations, for each, please tell me what kind of influence the group is having on the way things are going in your country.   Is the influence of the People's Assembly very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad or very bad in your country?",
  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The People's Assembly's influence on the country appears to be somewhat bad because it often hampers effective decision-making and delays important reforms, which worsens governance and public trust. These issues suggest its impact is more negative than positive, as it seems to obstruct progress rather than facilitate it.\n\nANSWER: C",
