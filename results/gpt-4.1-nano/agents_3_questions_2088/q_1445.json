This allows for better control and consideration of our country's specific needs, policies, and social contexts. While the EU's policies are important, ultimately, the sovereignty and management of migration flows should rest with our own government to ensure appropriate measures are taken that align with national interests and public opinion. \n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I believe the decision should primarily rest with my country's government, as it directly affects national policies, social services, and economic impacts within our borders. While the EU's policies influence migration, individual member states often need autonomy to address their specific circumstances and concerns. Therefore, I think our government should make decisions about migration of EU citizens into our country.\n\nANSWER: A",

While the EU has overarching frameworks and agreements, the specific management and regulation of migration should be under national control to address local needs and concerns effectively. Therefore, my opinion is that my government should make these decisions.\n\nANSWER: A",

Since EU citizenship grants rights across member states, decisions about internal migration are better handled collectively to ensure harmony, fairness, and adherence to EU regulations. This approach helps balance national sovereignty with collaborative governance, and policies can be more consistent across countries, benefiting all parties involved.\n\nANSWER: B",
