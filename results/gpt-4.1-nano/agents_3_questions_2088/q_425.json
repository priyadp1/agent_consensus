        "raw_output": "Given the varied history of the Ennahda Party and its shifting policies towards women's rights, opinions are mixed. Some believe that under their leadership, women's rights might improve due to political reforms or alliances aimed at modernizing the society. Others fear that the party's conservative elements could lead to restrictions on women's freedoms, especially if influenced by religious or traditional values. Overall, considering the potential for both progressive and conservative influences, many might expect the rights to stay relatively stable, though significant changes\u2014whether positive or negative\u2014are possible. Therefore, I think most people would perceive that women's rights will remain about the same under the current government.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe that under the Ennahda Party-led government, women may experience changes in their rights that could be either more or fewer, depending on the government's policies and societal influences. Historically, Islamic political parties like Ennahda have sometimes implemented policies that could lead to a reduction in women's rights compared to previous eras, especially if they focus on conservative social norms. However, they may also take steps to improve rights or maintain the status quo to balance societal expectations and political agendas. Given this, I think the most balanced view is that women will have about the same rights as before, as significant shifts could go both ways but might not drastically change the existing situation in the short term.\n\nANSWER: C",

Historically, Ennahda has oscillated in its approach to women's rights, balancing conservative influences with reform efforts, which suggests stability in the short term. Therefore, the most reasonable expectation is that there will be no major change in women's rights compared to previous periods.\n\nANSWER: C",
