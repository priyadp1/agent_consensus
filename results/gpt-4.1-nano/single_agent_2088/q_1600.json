  "raw_output": "Television has undergone significant changes over the years, impacting how we access information, entertainment, and culture. On one hand, modern television offers high-quality content, diverse programming, and instant access to global events, which many see as improvements. On the other hand, concerns exist about increased commercialization, decreased educational value, and the rise of mindless entertainment, which some argue has worsened its societal impact. Overall, I believe the change has brought both positive and negative effects, but the increased accessibility and variety have been particularly beneficial for viewers. \n\nANSWER: A",
