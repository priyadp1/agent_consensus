        "raw_output": "Tensions between Sunnis and Shias are not confined solely to Iraq; they reflect broader sectarian divides present in the wider Muslim world. Countries like Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen have experienced conflicts or tensions influenced by Sunni-Shia divisions, often exacerbated by political, regional, and ideological factors. These divides are rooted in historical, theological, and political differences that have been exploited or intensified in various contexts, making the issue more widespread than just Iraq. Therefore, the tensions are a growing problem that affects multiple countries across the Muslim world, not only Iraq.\n\nANSWER: B",

In countries like Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Pakistan, sectarian conflicts often align along Sunni-Shia lines and contribute to regional instability. These divisions are exacerbated by geopolitical rivalries and external influences, making the issue more widespread than a single national context.
