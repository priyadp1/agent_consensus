  "question": "In making international policy decisions, to what extent do you think China takes into account the interests of countries like your country - a great deal, a fair amount, not too much, or not at all?",
  "options": [
    "Great deal",
    "Fair amount",
    "Not too much",
    "Not at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that China considers the interests of other countries to a fair amount when making international policy decisions. While China often emphasizes strategic independence and prioritizes its own national goals, it also engages in diplomatic efforts, regional cooperation, and economic partnerships that suggest some level of consideration for other nations' concerns. Therefore, I think China's approach is not solely self-centered nor entirely neglectful of other interests, but balances its own interests with some regard for external factors. \n\nANSWER: B",
