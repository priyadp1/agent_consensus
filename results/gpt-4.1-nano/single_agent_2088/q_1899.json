  "raw_output": "The transformations in my country since 1991 have created a complex environment for public morality. While there have been positive changes such as increased individual freedoms and awareness, there has also been a rise in corruption, dishonesty, and social degradation in some areas. Overall, these changes seem to have more negatively impacted public morality by challenging traditional values and fostering behaviors that undermine social cohesion. Therefore, I believe the influence has been more detrimental than beneficial.\n\nANSWER: C",
