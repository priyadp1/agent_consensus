  "raw_output": "I believe that President Rodrigo Duterte's approach to relations with the United States has been somewhat complex. He initially shifted toward a more independent foreign policy, sometimes expressing a desire to diversify alliances and reduce dependence on traditional partners. While some may see this as a strategic move to assert Philippine sovereignty, others might perceive it as a period of diplomatic uncertainty. Given the mixed perceptions and the nuances involved, I lean toward disapproval, considering that a more consistent and traditional alliance with the United States is often seen as beneficial for the Philippines' security and economic interests.\n\nANSWER: B",
