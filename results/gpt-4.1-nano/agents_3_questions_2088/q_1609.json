        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "In my opinion, increasing economic sanctions against North Korea is the better option because it pressures the regime to abandon its nuclear ambitions through economic hardship, potentially encouraging negotiations without resorting to military conflict. Deepening ties might be seen as rewarding provocative behavior, which could undermine international efforts to denuclearize the region. A balanced approach focusing on sanctions emphasizes deterrence and diplomacy, making it the most prudent choice to address the nuclear threat effectively.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Increasing economic sanctions can pressure North Korea to reconsider its nuclear development, potentially leading to negotiations and denuclearization. Deepening ties might foster understanding and cooperation, but could also risk legitimizing a regime that continues its nuclear pursuits. A balanced approach may be necessary, but considering the goal of denuclearization, sanctions have historically been a primary tool to incentivize compliance. Therefore, I believe increasing economic sanctions is the better option. \n\nANSWER: A",

      "2": {
        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe increasing economic sanctions is the more effective approach because it applies pressure on the North Korean government to halt its nuclear development without immediate escalation into military conflict. Sanctions can limit resources and incentives for continuing their nuclear program, encouraging diplomatic negotiations. Deepening ties might inadvertently legitimize or reinforce their nuclear pursuits, and doing both could lead to mixed signals or unintended consequences. Therefore, focusing on economic sanctions appears to be a pragmatic strategy to encourage denuclearization. \n\nANSWER: A",

Sanctions have historically been a primary tool for incentivizing compliance and denuclearization, whereas deepening ties could risk legitimizing or bolstering their nuclear pursuits, potentially undermining efforts towards denuclearization.

Deepening ties may risk normalizing or legitimizing provocative behavior, which could undermine efforts to denuclearize the region. Using sanctions allows for a non-military approach focused on deterrence and diplomacy, aiming to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear development effectively.\n\nANSWER: A",

Utilizing sanctions offers a non-military strategy focused on diplomacy and coercion to achieve denuclearization goals.\n\nANSWER: A",

Diplomatic measures like sanctions can incentivize behavioral change without granting legitimacy, whereas deepening ties might reduce the perceived urgency for North Korea to denuclearize and could embolden their provocations.

Historically, sanctions have been utilized as a primary tool to discourage nuclear development and compel compliance with international norms.
