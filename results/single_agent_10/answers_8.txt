Question 8
Now I am going to read you a list of things that may be problems in our country.  As I read each one, please tell me if you think it is a very big problem, a moderately big problem, a small problem or not a problem at all...Air pollution

I believe air pollution is a very big problem. It directly impacts public health, causes respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and affects vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Additionally, air pollution contributes to climate change by releasing greenhouse gases, and it can damage ecosystems and reduce quality of life. Given its widespread impact and the challenges in controlling emissions from industries, transportation, and other sources, addressing air pollution is crucial for the well-being of society and the environment.
