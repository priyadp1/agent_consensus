  "question": "Now on a different subject, some people feel that democracy is a Western way of doing things that would not work in most Muslim countries, others think that democracy is not just for the West and can work well in most Muslim countries. Which comes closer to your opinion?",
  "options": [
    "Democracy would not work well in Muslim countries",
    "Democracy would work well"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that democracy can work well in Muslim countries because the core principles of democracy, such as participation, representation, and rule of law, are universal and can be adapted to different cultural contexts. While cultural and historical factors may influence the implementation process, there is no inherent reason why democratic systems cannot succeed in Muslim-majority countries with appropriate tailoring to local customs and societal values.\n\nANSWER: B"
