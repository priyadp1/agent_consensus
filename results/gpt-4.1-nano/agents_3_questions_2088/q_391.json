        "raw_output": "Banning the wearing of the Burqa can be seen as a violation of individual freedom and religious expression. It may marginalize Muslim women and prevent them from practicing their faith openly. While concerns about security or integration might motivate such laws, policies that restrict religious attire should be carefully balanced with respect for personal rights and cultural diversity. Imposing bans could also lead to social divisions and feelings of alienation among Muslim communities, which is counterproductive to social cohesion. Therefore, such bans are more likely to be a bad idea, as they may undermine principles of religious freedom and individual rights.\n\nANSWER: B",
