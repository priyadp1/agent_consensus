        "raw_output": "The reliability of the United States as an ally is a complex issue that depends on various factors such as political leadership, international commitments, and global stability. Historically, the U.S. has been seen as a strong supporter of its allies, often providing military and economic assistance during crises. However, at times it has also experienced shifts in foreign policy that have led some to question its consistency and long-term commitment. While many consider it a fundamentally reliable partner, others point to instances of sudden policy changes or strategic withdrawals that can undermine trust. Overall, the perception of the U.S. as an ally varies among different countries and contexts, but it generally remains a significant and influential ally in global affairs.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it has historically provided strong support and was instrumental in many international efforts, there are times when shifts in policies and strategic priorities cause some uncertainty. These fluctuations can affect perceptions of its consistency and reliability, but overall, the U.S. remains a significant partner on the global stage. This nuanced view aligns more closely with a moderate level of reliability rather than the extremes of very or not reliable at all.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe the United States is a somewhat reliable ally because, historically, it has shown a strong commitment to supporting its allies through military and economic aid, but at the same time, certain foreign policy shifts and strategic interests have at times caused uncertainty and questioned long-term dependability. These fluctuations influence perceptions, making it not completely steadfast, yet still fundamentally an influential partner. \n\nANSWER: B",

While it generally demonstrates strong support and commitment to its allies, there have also been periods of uncertainty, shifts in foreign policy, or strategic adjustments that can affect perceptions of reliability. Considering both the consistent efforts and occasional unpredictability, I believe it falls into the category of being fairly dependable, but not without some variability depending on circumstances. Therefore, I would select a middle-ground option that recognizes both strengths and limitations.\n\nANSWER: B",

Although it generally demonstrates a strong commitment to its allies through military support, economic assistance, and diplomatic backing, there have been instances where foreign policy shifts or strategic adjustments have created uncertainty about its long-term reliability. This mixture of consistent support and occasional unpredictability suggests a level of dependability that is substantial but not absolute.
