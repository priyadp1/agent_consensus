        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, the availability of good-paying jobs in our country has generally declined due to various economic challenges, including inflation, shifts in the job market, and disruptions caused by global events like the pandemic. While some sectors may have seen growth, many workers continue to struggle with job stability and wages that do not keep pace with living costs. Therefore, overall, the situation has worsened for most people seeking quality employment opportunities.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, the availability of good-paying jobs in our country has experienced mixed trends depending on the region and industry. While some sectors, especially technology and healthcare, have seen growth and higher wages, other traditional industries like manufacturing and retail have faced declines, layoffs, or stagnant wages. Economic factors such as inflation, global market shifts, and policy changes have also affected job quality and pay. Overall, the picture is complex, but on balance, many workers have found it harder to secure good-paying jobs due to increased competition, automation, and economic challenges. Therefore, I believe that the availability of good-paying jobs has generally worsened over the last five years.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, the availability of good-paying jobs has experienced a mixed situation, with some sectors seeing growth and others facing setbacks. Certain industries, such as technology and healthcare, have seen an increase in well-paying opportunities, partly due to innovation and demand. However, other sectors, especially those affected by automation, globalization, or economic downturns, have seen a decline or stagnation in high-quality job availability. Overall, these fluctuations suggest that the situation has not consistently improved and that many individuals may still struggle to find well-paying jobs, leading to a perception that there has been no clear overall improvement.\n\nANSWER: B",

Some sectors like technology and healthcare have experienced growth and higher wages, indicating improvements. However, other sectors such as manufacturing and retail have faced declines or stagnation, and factors like automation and economic challenges have worsened job prospects in many areas. Given the overall complexity and the fact that many individuals still struggle to find well-paying jobs despite some growth in certain industries, I believe the general trend has not been an improvement but rather a worsening or at best a stagnant situation.\n\nANSWER: B",
