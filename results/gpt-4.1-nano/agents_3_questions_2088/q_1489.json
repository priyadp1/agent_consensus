This suggests a flexible adjustment rather than a fixed stance, but in terms of the given options, I lean toward the idea of empowering the EU further to promote unity and efficiency. Therefore, I would choose the option that advocates for transferring more powers to the EU.\n\nANSWER: A",

However, I also think that certain powers should be returned to national governments to respect sovereignty and diversity among member states. A nuanced transfer of responsibilities can help address pressing global challenges while maintaining national identity and democratic accountability.
