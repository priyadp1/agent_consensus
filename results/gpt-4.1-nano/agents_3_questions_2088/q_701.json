        "raw_output": "I believe that sex between unmarried adults is a personal matter that varies based on individual values and cultural contexts. For some, it might be seen as morally acceptable if it occurs within a consenting and respectful relationship. Others may consider it morally unacceptable based on their religious or cultural beliefs. Since morality is often subjective and context-dependent, I think it can be viewed differently depending on the situation, making it not strictly a moral issue universally. \n\nANSWER: D",

      "1": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe that sex between unmarried adults is not a moral issue because personal beliefs about morality and relationships vary greatly across different cultures and individuals. What matters more is the mutual consent, respect, and well-being of the involved parties rather than whether they are married. Labeling it as morally acceptable or unacceptable oversimplifies the complexities of personal morality and cultural differences.\n\nANSWER: C",

      "2": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe that sex between unmarried adults is not a moral issue because personal morality varies greatly among individuals, and consensual adult relationships should be considered a private matter without a universal moral judgment. Societal attitudes have become more accepting over time, emphasizing personal freedom and choice rather than strict moral condemnation. Therefore, assigning a moral label to consensual adult intimacy seems unnecessary and unhelpful in diverse moral frameworks.\n\nANSWER: C",

What matters most is that the relationship is consensual, respectful, and does not cause harm. Labeling such personal choices as moral or immoral oversimplifies the diversity of moral perspectives and the importance of personal autonomy. Recognizing that this is a private matter allows different moral frameworks to coexist without imposing a universal judgment.\n\nANSWER: C",
