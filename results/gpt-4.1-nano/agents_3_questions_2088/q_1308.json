        "raw_output": "Politicians have experienced significant benefits from the changes since 1989 / 1991, especially in terms of increased access to information, media attention, and the ability to influence policy. However, these changes have also led to increased scrutiny and challenges, which can diminish perceived benefits. Overall, considering both the opportunities and obstacles, many might see moderate benefit but not necessarily a great deal.

While some have experienced positive changes, such as improved access to information and increased accountability, many still face significant challenges like mistrust from the public and ongoing political polarization. Overall, it's unlikely that politicians as a group have benefited a great deal, but they may have gained some fair amount of advantage in certain circumstances.
