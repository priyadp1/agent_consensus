  "options": [
    "Very important",
    "Somewhat important",
    "Not too important",
    "Not important at all"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that religious influence in global affairs should balance respect for diversity and human rights. While I understand the importance of cultural and religious identities, I do not think that any religion, including Islam, should have an overarching influence that shapes policies and societal structures worldwide. Promoting mutual understanding and secular principles is more beneficial for harmonious coexistence. Therefore, I consider that it is not too important for Islam to have a more influential role globally.\n\nANSWER: C"
