        "raw_output": "I believe that the role of Islam in the world should be balanced with respect for diverse beliefs and secular governance. An overly influential role might risk marginalizing other perspectives and undermining pluralism. Therefore, I do not see it as very important for Islam to have a more prominent influence globally.

While understanding and appreciating the cultural and spiritual contributions of Islam is important, I do not think it should necessarily play a more dominant role globally to the point of overshadowing other beliefs or secular principles.
