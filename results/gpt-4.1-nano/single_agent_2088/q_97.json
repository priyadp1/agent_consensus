  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the United States considers the interests of other countries and its own national interests to some extent, but it heavily prioritizes its own strategic and economic goals in international policy decisions. While some efforts are made to consider global interests, it often focuses more on advancing its own priorities. Therefore, I think it takes a fair amount into account, but not necessarily a great deal.  \nANSWER: B"
