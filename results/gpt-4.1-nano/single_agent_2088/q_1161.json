    "None (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the Indian National Congress (INC) could do a better job in ending political deadlock because they have historically played a role in fostering coalition-building and dialogue among different political groups, which is essential for resolving deadlocks. Additionally, their experience in governance might enable them to facilitate constructive negotiations better. While the BJP has been influential in recent times, their approach sometimes seems more confrontational, which may not always help in overcoming deadlock situations. Therefore, I think the INC might be better suited for this specific task.\n\nANSWER: B",
