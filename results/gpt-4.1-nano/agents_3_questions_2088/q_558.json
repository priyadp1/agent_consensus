        "raw_output": "Since becoming president in 2013, Nicolas Maduro has largely maintained many of Hugo Chavez's policies, especially regarding social programs, anti-imperialist rhetoric, and efforts to uphold Chavismo's political ideology. However, there have been shifts in economic management and responses to increasing economic crises, which suggest some divergence from Chavez's original approach. Overall, Maduro's policies reflect a strong continuity with Chavez's legacy, though not an exact replica, indicating he has followed them quite closely but with some adaptations. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Since becoming president in 2013, Nicolas Maduro has claimed to uphold the policies and legacy of Hugo Chavez, but in practice, there have been notable differences in how he has managed the country's economy, politics, and social programs. While Maduro has maintained some Ch\u00e1vez-era rhetoric and certain socialist policies, many observers view his approach as diverging due to the increasing authoritarian tendencies, economic crises, and shifts in diplomatic relations. Therefore, I believe Maduro has followed Chavez's policies somewhat closely, but not entirely.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Since becoming president in 2013, Nicolas Maduro has continued many of Hugo Chavez's socialist policies, such as maintaining social programs, nationalism, and a strong stance against U.S. influence. However, Maduro's approach has been somewhat more pragmatic and less ideologically driven, especially given the economic and political crises he's faced, which have led to shifts in policy emphasis and implementation. While the core ideals are still present, the extent of alignment has somewhat diminished compared to Chavez's era. Therefore, I believe Maduro has followed Chavez's policies somewhat closely.  \nANSWER: B",

While Maduro has endeavored to uphold Chavez\u2019s socialist ideals and certain social programs, there have been notable divergences in approach, especially given the economic hardships, shifts in diplomatic strategy, and increasing authoritarian tendencies observed during Maduro\u2019s presidency. These differences suggest that while the core values remain, the execution and emphasis have evolved, leading me to select the \"somewhat closely\" option.\n\nANSWER: B",

While Maduro has maintained core socialist policies, social programs, and anti-imperialist rhetoric reminiscent of Chavez\u2019s era, there have been notable shifts in economic management and pragmatic adjustments to crises, indicating some divergence. These adaptations suggest a continuation of Chavez\u2019s legacy but not an unaltered replication.
