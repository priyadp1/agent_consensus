  "question": "Which is more important to you...That Egypt has a democratic government even if there is some risk of political instability, or that Egypt has a stable government, even if there is a risk it will not be fully democratic?",
  "options": [
    "That Egypt has a democratic government, even if there is some risk of political instability",
    "That Egypt has a stable government, even if there is a risk it will not be fully democratic"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that having a democratic government is fundamentally important because it ensures citizens have a voice, protection of rights, and accountability from leaders. While political stability is valuable, it shouldn't come at the expense of democracy, as long-term stability can often be better maintained within a democratic framework. A government that is not fully democratic but stable may lack legitimacy and social cohesion in the long run, but a democratic government, even with some risk of instability, aligns with principles of fairness and individual rights. Therefore, prioritizing democracy is more important to me.\n\nANSWER: A"
