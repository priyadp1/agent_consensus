        "raw_output": "Since the reunification of Germany, many structural differences and disparities in economic development and quality of life between the former East and West still exist. While substantial progress has been made in improving infrastructure, healthcare, and other social services in East Germany, many people believe that, on average, the standard of living in East Germany has not fully caught up to West German levels. Persistent regional inequalities suggest that the gap remains, even after several decades. Therefore, I believe East Germany has not yet achieved the same standard of living as those in West Germany.\n\nANSWER: B",
