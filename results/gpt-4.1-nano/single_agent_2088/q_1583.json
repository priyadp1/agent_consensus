  "question": "Do you think this change in the gap between rich and poor people is largely because of the way the world has become more connected or mostly for other reasons?",
  "options": [
    "Largely more connected",
    "Other reasons"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the increasing gap between rich and poor is primarily due to other reasons rather than global connectedness. Factors such as technological advancements, policy decisions, economic systems, and educational disparities tend to have a more direct impact on income inequality. While globalization and connectivity can influence economic dynamics, they are not the main drivers behind the widening wealth gap. Therefore, it seems more accurate to attribute this change to structural issues within societies and economies. \n\nANSWER: B",
