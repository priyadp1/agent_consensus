        "raw_output": "In my view, while the US has made efforts to collaborate with allies and involve them in certain operations against terrorism, there are instances where strategic and political interests appear to dominate decisions. The pursuit of national security sometimes seems to override extensive considerations of partner nations' specific concerns or priorities. Overall, the US seems to primarily act in ways that serve its own interests, even when working with international partners. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "In my view, while the US has involved its allies in various operations against terrorism, there is also substantial evidence suggesting that many actions are primarily driven by US strategic interests. Alliances tend to be flexible, with the US sometimes acting unilaterally or prioritizing its own security objectives, which indicates a tendency to act mainly on its own interests. Therefore, I believe the US's approach leans more toward acting predominantly for its own benefit rather than fully considering its allies' interests.\n\nANSWER: B",

There have been instances where allied nations' concerns and perspectives appeared to be secondary to U.S. priorities, such as unilateral military interventions or policy decisions that benefit U.S. geopolitical aims. This suggests that the US often acts mainly on its own interests, even when engaging with allies.\n\nANSWER: B",
