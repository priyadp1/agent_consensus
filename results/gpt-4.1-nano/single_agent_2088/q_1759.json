  "question": "When there are differences between the US and European countries, do you think these differences occur because the US has different values than Europe or because the US has different policies than Europe?",
  "options": [
    "Different Values",
    "Different Policies"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the differences between the US and European countries are primarily rooted in divergent values. Values tend to shape fundamental attitudes and long-term cultural perspectives, which influence policies but are the deeper cause of the variations observed. Policies are often reflections of underlying values; thus, differing values lead to distinct policy choices over time.\n\nANSWER: A",
