        "raw_output": "The gap between rich and poor is often viewed as a significant issue because it can lead to social inequality, limit access to opportunities for a large segment of the population, and create social tensions. In many countries, this disparity is seen as a key factor contributing to other problems such as crime, health disparities, and political instability.
