  "question": "Here are some reasons given for using military force against Iraq. As I read a reason, tell me if it is a very important, fairly important, or not important reason to justify the use of military force against Iraq.  First, if we learned that Iraq is developing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, would that be a very important reason, fairly important reason, or not important reason to justify the use of military force against Iraq?",
  "options": [
    "Very important reason",
    "Fairly important reason",
    "Not important reason"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "If Iraq is developing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, it poses a significant threat to regional and global security. Such weapons could be used to attack other nations, cause massive loss of life, and destabilize the region. Preventing the proliferation of these weapons is widely regarded as a core reason for military intervention in cases like Iraq. Therefore, this would be considered a very important reason to justify the use of military force.\n\nANSWER: A",
