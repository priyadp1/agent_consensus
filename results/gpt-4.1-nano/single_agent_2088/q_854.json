  "question": "In general, would you say the government is run for the benefit of all the people in your country or is it run for the benefit of only a few groups of people?",
  "options": [
    "Benefit all",
    "Benefit few groups",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the government tends to prioritize the interests of a select few groups rather than the broader population. This perception might stem from observations of unequal distribution of resources, policies that favor specific industries or elite groups, and ongoing inequalities in society. While some efforts exist to serve the common good, my impression is that the system often benefits those with more influence or power. \n\nANSWER: B"
