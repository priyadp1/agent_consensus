At times, Turkey has expressed support for democratic processes and has advocated for democratic reforms in neighboring countries. However, there have also been instances where Turkey\u2019s actions, strategic interests, or political considerations seem to prioritize stability or regional influence over promoting democracy, leading to perceptions of opposition. Overall, given the mixed signals and evolving policies, it is challenging to definitively categorize the government's stance as consistently favoring or opposing democracy across the entire region.\n\nANSWER: C",
