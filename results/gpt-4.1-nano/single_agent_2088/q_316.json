  "question": "I'm going to describe various types of political systems and ask what you think about each as a way of governing our country. For each one, would it be a very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad or very bad way of governing this country? c. a system in which a strong leader can make decisions without interference from parliament or the courts",
  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "A system where a strong leader can make decisions without interference from parliament or the courts might be efficient in certain situations, especially during emergencies, but it generally raises concerns about abuse of power, lack of checks and balances, and potential suppression of dissent. Without oversight, such a leader could implement policies that are not in the best interest of the broader population, and it could undermine democracy. Therefore, I think this would be a very bad way of governing the country.\n\nANSWER: D"
