Factors such as rising income inequality, uneven access to opportunities, and economic policies that favor the wealthy contribute to this trend.

While some initiatives aim to address this gap, overall data suggests that the disparity between rich and poor has widened in numerous regions, including my country.

Additionally, policies and economic trends have favored those at the top, making wealth accumulation easier for the rich while the middle and lower classes face stagnation or decline.
