  "question": "On another topic, had you heard that President Barack Obama's mother once worked in Pakistan, or hadn't you heard this?",
  "options": [
    "Had heard",
    "Had not heard"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I recall that there have been some claims and rumors circulating suggesting that Ann Dunham, Barack Obama's mother, worked or spent time in Pakistan at some point. However, I also remember that there is no verified or widely confirmed information to support this claim. Given the uncertainty and the lack of concrete evidence, I would say I have not heard definitively that she worked there, though I am aware of the rumors. Therefore, based on the certainty of information, I would choose that I have not heard this.\n\nANSWER: B",
