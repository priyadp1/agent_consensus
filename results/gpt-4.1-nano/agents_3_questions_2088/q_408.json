        "raw_output": "Rising prices can significantly affect household budgets, especially for essential goods and services, leading to financial stress for many families. This can reduce consumer spending and hurt overall economic growth. For this reason, I believe that rising prices pose a major threat to the country's economic well-being, as they can trigger inflationary spirals and undermine economic stability if not addressed effectively.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that rising prices are a major threat because inflation can significantly reduce consumers' purchasing power, increase the cost of living, and strain household budgets. When prices rise rapidly or unpredictably, it can also create uncertainty in the economy, discourage investment, and hinder economic growth. Managing inflation is crucial to maintaining economic stability and ensuring that people can afford essential goods and services without undue hardship.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Rising prices can significantly impact the economic well-being of a country by reducing consumers' purchasing power, increasing the cost of living, and potentially leading to inflation. When prices increase rapidly or persistently, financial stability can be threatened, especially if wages do not keep pace with inflation. While some may view these increases as manageable or temporary, for many individuals and families, rising costs create a substantial challenge that can hinder economic growth and stability. Therefore, I believe that rising prices pose a major threat to the country's economic well-being.\n\nANSWER: A",
