        "raw_output": "The migration of people seeking jobs abroad can have mixed implications for our country. On one hand, it can lead to a loss of skilled workers and potential economic setbacks, making it a significant concern. On the other hand, it might also result in remittances and international connections that benefit the economy, and some may see it as a natural part of globalization. However, overall, the movement of large numbers of our citizens abroad for work is generally viewed as a notable issue, especially if it causes a substantial brain drain or economic hardship. Therefore, I believe this phenomenon is a moderately big problem for our country.\n\nANSWER: B",
