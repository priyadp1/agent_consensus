    "Bad"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Yes, I heard about his death. The killing of a militant leader like Baitullah Mehsud could be seen as a positive development if it leads to reduced violence and increased security, as it might weaken the militant organization. However, such actions can also lead to instability or retaliation, and may not always result in long-term peace. Overall, I believe it is a good thing because it potentially removes a significant threat and could help bring stability to the region.\n\nANSWER: A",
