        "raw_output": "The impact of U.S. economic aid on my country seems to vary depending on the context and how it is utilized. In some cases, it has helped improve infrastructure, health, and education, fostering positive development. However, there are also concerns about dependency, misallocation, or influence that does not always align with local needs. Overall, while the aid has potential benefits, the net effect appears to be mixed, making it difficult to classify as outright positive or negative. Given this nuance, I believe the aid has not overwhelmingly shifted the country in either direction, leading me to choose no impact.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The impact of U.S. economic aid can vary greatly depending on the specific country, the type of aid provided, and how it is implemented. In many cases, aid can help improve infrastructure, healthcare, and education, which might contribute to positive development. However, some may perceive it as creating dependency or not addressing core issues effectively, leading to skepticism about its overall benefits. If I consider general perceptions, I might lean towards acknowledging some positive effects while recognizing complexities, but without specific context, it's difficult to determine a definitive impact. \n\nGiven the options and typical debates surrounding aid, I would say that in many countries, U.S. economic aid tends to have more positive than negative effects, even if not perfect.\n\nANSWER: A",
