        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, there has been a mixed picture regarding people's ability to provide for themselves in old age. While some advancements in social safety nets and financial literacy may have helped, overall many continue to face challenges such as insufficient retirement savings, rising healthcare costs, and economic instability. As a result, the general trend suggests that the ability of people to secure their old age has not significantly improved and may have worsened due to ongoing economic pressures and changing job markets.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Over the past five years, the ability of people to provide for themselves in their old age has seemed to decline in many parts of the country. This is primarily due to economic challenges such as rising living costs, insufficient retirement savings, and uncertainties around pension systems. Additionally, shifts in employment patterns, like the decline of traditional pensions and the rise of gig work, have made it more difficult for individuals to secure stable income and savings for retirement. Consequently, many feel less confident about their financial security in old age than they did five years ago.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Over the last five years, the ability of people to provide for themselves in their old age has generally deteriorated in many countries due to several factors. Economic instability, increasing costs of living, insufficient pension schemes, and the decline in traditional solidarity-based support systems have contributed to making it harder for individuals to secure their financial future. Despite some efforts to improve social security systems, these challenges have largely resulted in a worsening situation for many, especially among vulnerable populations. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that this aspect has become worse over the recent years.\n\nANSWER: B",
