        "raw_output": "I believe the U.S. political system faces significant challenges such as political polarization, instances of government gridlock, and concerns about representation and transparency. While the system has mechanisms for accountability and has produced effective governance at times, these issues often hinder its overall effectiveness, leading many to see it as only somewhat functional rather than very effective. Therefore, I would say it works somewhat well.\n\nANSWER: B",
