  "question": "Before the war the U.S. and Britain claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. These weapons have yet to be found. Why do you think they made this claim: [READ]",
  "options": [
    "US and British leaders were  misinformed by bad intelligence",
    "US and British leaders lied to provide a reason for invading",
    "WMD might still be found (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the claim about weapons of mass destruction was influenced by a combination of factors. While intelligence might have been flawed or misinterpreted, there is also a possibility that leaders intentionally used the threat to justify their decision to go to war. The idea that WMD could still be found keeps some suspicion open, but the primary reason seems to involve political motives and the manipulation of intelligence. Therefore, I think the most plausible reason is that leaders intentionally lied or exaggerated the threat to gain support for invasion. \n\nANSWER: B"
