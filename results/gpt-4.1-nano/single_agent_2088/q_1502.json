  "question": "Overall, would you say U.S. economic aid to Pakistan is having a mostly positive impact, a mostly negative impact, or no impact on the way things are going in Pakistan? ",
  "options": [
    "Mostly positive",
    "Mostly negative",
    "No impact"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "U.S. economic aid to Pakistan has historically aimed to support development and stability, but the impact has been mixed. While some development projects have improved infrastructure and provided economic opportunities, critics argue that the aid has not always led to sustainable growth or addressed core governance issues. Additionally, concerns about aid being diverted or not reaching intended beneficiaries contribute to skepticism. Overall, the aid's impact seems to be more complicated than simply positive or negative, but based on the broader influence, it appears to have created some benefits while also facing significant challenges that limit its effectiveness. Therefore, I believe the impact is more negative than positive.\n\nANSWER: B",
