        "raw_output": "China's significant emissions and its rapid economic growth can have a substantial impact on the global environment, which in turn affects the U.S. through climate change and ecological consequences. Since environmental issues are interconnected and China's actions influence global efforts to combat climate change, this is a pressing concern for the U.S. as well. I believe this should be regarded as a very serious problem because addressing global environmental health requires collaborative international action, and neglecting China\u2019s role could undermine efforts worldwide.\n\nANSWER: A",
