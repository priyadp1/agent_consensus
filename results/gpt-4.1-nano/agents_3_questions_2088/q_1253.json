        "raw_output": "Pakistani influence in Afghanistan is a complex issue for India. Given Pakistan's strategic backing of certain groups and its role in Afghanistan's stability, it poses some level of concern for India. However, the extent of this influence and its direct impact can vary, and India has diplomatic and strategic means to counter or mitigate this influence. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider it a moderately significant concern rather than an extremely urgent or negligible problem.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Pakistani influence in Afghanistan has long been a concern for India, especially given the complex regional dynamics and historical ties. While some may argue that it poses a very big problem due to security threats, insurgency support, and influence over Taliban activities, others might see it as a moderately big problem but not an existential threat. The influence is significant enough to warrant serious attention, but not necessarily at the highest level of threat as a very big problem. Therefore, considering the broader context and the ongoing regional tensions, it seems that Pakistani influence in Afghanistan represents a moderately big problem for India.\n\nANSWER: B",

Given Pakistan's strategic interest in Afghanistan and its alleged support for certain groups, many perceive it as a substantial challenge for India, especially considering ongoing tensions and security concerns. While it may not be the sole or most critical problem India faces, it remains a serious and persistent issue that demands careful diplomatic and security strategies. Therefore, it is best understood as a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

While some consider it a very big problem due to the potential threats and strategic challenges involved, others see it as a moderately big problem implying its importance but not necessarily an immediate, top-tier threat. Given the regional complexities and ongoing tensions, I believe it falls closer to the moderately big problem category because it demands attention but may not be the most critical issue India faces overall.\n\nANSWER: B",

Historically, Pakistan's strategic backing of certain groups and its role in Afghanistan's affairs have contributed to ongoing tensions with India, especially in terms of security threats and insurgent activities. While India has developed diplomatic and strategic responses, the influence still poses a considerable challenge, though perhaps not at the level of being the most catastrophic or immediate threat. Considering this, it seems that the influence is substantial but not necessarily at the highest tier of concern. Therefore, I believe it is a moderately big problem for India.\n\nANSWER: B",

This influence has significant implications for regional security, as it can lead to increased insurgency, destabilization, and strategic threats. While India has been actively working to counter these influences through diplomatic and strategic measures, the persistence of this influence continues to pose a substantial challenge.
