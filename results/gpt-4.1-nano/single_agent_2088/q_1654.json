  "options": [
    "A large influence",
    "Some influence",

    "No influence at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Religious leaders can play an important role in guiding moral and ethical values within society, but when it comes to political decisions, their influence should be limited to ensure the separation of church and state. This helps maintain a fair and inclusive political system where diverse perspectives are considered, and no group\u2019s beliefs dominate policy-making. Therefore, I believe they should have some influence, but not too much, to balance moral guidance with democratic principles.\n\nANSWER: B",
