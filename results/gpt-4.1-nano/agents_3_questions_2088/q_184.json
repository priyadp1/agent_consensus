        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe the influence of The Congress is somewhat bad because, in my country, there is often a perception that political institutions, including Congress, are ineffective or influenced by interests that do not prioritize the general population's needs. This has led to a sense of frustration among citizens, and many feel that Congress could do more to address pressing issues. Although there are efforts at reform, progress seems limited, and its impact is generally viewed as not beneficial enough for the country's development.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The influence of The Congress can vary widely depending on the country's political climate and recent actions. If The Congress has been actively working towards positive reforms, supporting development, and listening to public needs, its influence might be seen as beneficial. Conversely, if it has been involved in corruption, inefficiency, or conflicts that hinder progress, the perception would be negative. Considering the common issues faced, I believe that The Congress's influence in my country is more harmful than helpful, leading to stagnation or setbacks. Therefore, I think its overall impact is somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C",

While there are occasions when it tries to serve the public interests, frequent issues like political gridlock, corruption, and lack of efficiency often hinder effective decision-making.
