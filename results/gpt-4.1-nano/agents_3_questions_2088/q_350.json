        "raw_output": "The increasing use of the Internet has a complex impact on morality. On one hand, it provides access to valuable information and promotes awareness of ethical issues, which can enhance moral understanding and behavior. On the other hand, the Internet also facilitates the spread of unethical content, such as misinformation, hate speech, and harmful behaviors, which can undermine moral standards. Overall, the influence varies depending on how individuals and communities engage with online content, but it has generally created significant challenges to maintaining moral integrity. Therefore, I believe the Internet's influence on morality has been mostly negative, as it often amplifies immoral behaviors and content, despite some positive aspects. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The increasing use of the Internet has significantly impacted morality in our society. On one hand, it has made information more accessible, promoting awareness and understanding of ethical issues. On the other hand, it has also facilitated the spread of harmful content, dishonesty, and behaviors that can erode moral standards. Overall, these mixed effects suggest that the influence is not entirely beneficial or harmful but has the potential to sway morality in both directions. However, considering the predominant concerns about moral decline due to exposure to inappropriate content and behaviors online, it seems the negative aspects have a stronger influence. Therefore, I believe the Internet's influence on morality has been mostly detrimental.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The increasing use of the Internet has had mixed effects on morality. On one hand, it provides access to a wide range of educational and ethical resources that can promote good values and awareness. On the other hand, it also facilitates exposure to unethical behaviors, misinformation, and malicious content that can erode moral standards. Overall, the impact largely depends on how individuals and society as a whole engage with online content, making it difficult to categorize the influence as purely good or bad. Therefore, it seems that the influence has been neutral or has not significantly altered overall moral standards at a societal level.\n\nANSWER: C",
