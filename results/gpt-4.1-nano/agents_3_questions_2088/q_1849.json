While working with allies is important, Americans often prioritize policies that serve their national well-being, especially when disagreements arise. Additionally, being active in world affairs is generally beneficial for the country's security and influence, but the core principle remains that national interests should guide foreign policy decisions.  \nANSWER: B",
