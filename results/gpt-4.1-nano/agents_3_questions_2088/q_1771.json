        "raw_output": "Supporting the deployment of U.S. troops in Mexico could potentially help strengthen efforts against drug traffickers through increased military support. However, it also raises concerns about sovereignty, the potential for escalation, and unintended consequences that could negatively impact relations and stability in the region. Personally, I believe that such a measure should only be considered after thorough consultation with Mexico and other international partners, and if it is part of a broader, carefully planned strategy that emphasizes cooperation and respect for national sovereignty. For these reasons, I would oppose deploying U.S. troops in Mexico.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Supporting the deployment of U.S. troops in Mexico could be viewed as a strong measure to help combat drug trafficking effectively. It might bring immediate resources, expertise, and strategic advantage in dismantling traffickers. However, deploying troops could also escalate tensions, risk diplomatic issues, or lead to unintended consequences such as increased violence or violations of sovereignty. The decision should carefully weigh the potential benefits of enhanced security against the risks of military intervention and possible negative repercussions on U.S.-Mexico relations and regional stability.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Deploying U.S. troops in Mexico is a complex and sensitive issue. On one hand, it could strengthen efforts to combat drug traffickers directly and potentially reduce violence and illegal activities. On the other hand, involving U.S. troops on Mexican soil might infringe on Mexico\u2019s sovereignty and could provoke political or social backlash within Mexico and the broader region. Many people might also worry about escalation of conflict or unintended consequences. Given these concerns, I personally oppose deploying U.S. troops in Mexico, preferring more collaborative, diplomatic, and covert strategies that respect Mexico\u2019s sovereignty while addressing the drug trafficking issues effectively.\n\nANSWER: B",
