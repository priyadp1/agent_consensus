        "raw_output": "Deciding whether a young person should move abroad or stay in their country depends on various factors such as economic opportunities, safety, social stability, and personal goals. If the country offers good prospects for education, work, and personal growth, staying might be the best choice to build a future within a familiar environment and community. Conversely, if the country struggles with issues like limited opportunities, corruption, or insecurity, exploring options elsewhere could provide a better chance for a prosperous and fulfilling life. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a careful assessment of individual circumstances and the potential benefits and drawbacks of both options.\n\nANSWER: B",

If the country offers promising prospects, stability, and opportunities for growth, staying might be the better choice to contribute to and benefit from local development. However, if the local environment is lacking in opportunities, safety concerns, or restrictive policies, exploring options abroad could provide a better chance for success and fulfillment.

Moving abroad can provide benefits, but it also involves significant challenges such as adaptation and distance from familiar support systems. In the long term, building a life here can be more sustainable and meaningful if the country continues to improve its prospects. Therefore, I believe staying is generally the better option for someone seeking a good life, provided there are efforts to enhance local conditions.\n\nANSWER: B",
