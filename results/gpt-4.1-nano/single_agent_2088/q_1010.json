  "options": [
    "The Taliban",
    "India",
    "al Qaeda",
    "All of these (VOL)",
    "None of these (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Among the listed threats, I believe India poses the greatest concern due to its significant regional influence, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and internal security challenges. While the Taliban and al Qaeda are serious threats, their current level of capability and reach are comparatively less impactful on the national level than the potential destabilization that could result from issues involving India, especially considering nuclear capabilities and border disputes. Therefore, I see India as the most pressing threat to the country at this moment.\n\nANSWER: B",
