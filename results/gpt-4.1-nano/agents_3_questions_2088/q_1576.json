        "raw_output": "Nicolas Sarkozy's handling of the European economic crisis received mixed reviews. While he implemented several measures to stabilize the French economy and participated actively in EU discussions, some critics argued that his approach was not sufficiently comprehensive or effective in addressing deeper structural issues. Public opinion likely varied, with some perceiving his efforts as moderately positive, while others viewed them as inadequate or overly cautious. Considering these factors, a balanced assessment would suggest a somewhat positive evaluation but not necessarily exemplary. Therefore, I believe he did a somewhat good job.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "During Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency, his handling of the European economic crisis received mixed reviews. Some considered his efforts to stabilize the French economy and collaborate within the EU as constructive, indicating a somewhat good performance. Others criticized his policies as insufficient or ineffective in addressing the depth of the crisis, suggesting a somewhat bad job. Given the overall regional economic turmoil and France's challenges during that period, his management was perhaps more moderate than significantly positive or negative. Therefore, choosing a middle-ground assessment seems appropriate.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "In evaluating Nicolas Sarkozy's handling of the European economic crisis, opinions are mixed. During his presidency, Sarkozy worked to stabilize the French economy and participate actively in European Union efforts to address the crisis, often advocating for austerity measures and financial reforms. However, critics argue that some of his policies either fell short or worsened public dissatisfaction, and his approach faced challenges in balancing economic stability with social impact. Given this context, many people might see his efforts as somewhat effective but not outstanding, reflecting a moderate level of success rather than an excellent or poor performance.\n\nANSWER: B",
