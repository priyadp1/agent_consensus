        "raw_output": "The impact of U.S. military aid to Pakistan is complex and multifaceted. While it can help bolster Pakistan's security capabilities and foster cooperation between the two countries, it has also faced criticism for not always leading to stable or positive outcomes in the region. The aid has sometimes been associated with unintended consequences, such as bolstering military capabilities that may not align with peace efforts or contributing to instability. Therefore, considering both the potential benefits and drawbacks, it appears that the overall impact tends to be perceived as more negative than positive.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The impact of U.S. military aid to Pakistan is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, it has helped in counterterrorism efforts and in maintaining strategic stability in the region. On the other hand, such aid can sometimes exacerbate tensions, fuel corruption, or bolster military influences that may not align with democratic development. Given these nuanced effects, overall, the aid appears to have a mixed to somewhat negative influence, with more of the challenges outweighing the positive outcomes in the long term.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The impact of U.S. military aid to Pakistan is complex and can be viewed from different perspectives. Supporters argue that it helps strengthen Pakistan's security and counterterrorism efforts, which can stabilize the region. However, critics contend that such aid often fails to produce the desired effects and may even exacerbate regional tensions or foster dependency, thereby undermining long-term stability. Given these considerations, the overall impact seems to lean more towards being negative, especially considering concerns about aid fueling conflicts or corruption rather than truly fostering development or security. Therefore, I believe it has had a mostly negative impact on the situation in Pakistan.\n\nANSWER: B",
