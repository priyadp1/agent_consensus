  "question": "Do you think the next presidential election in our country will be conducted fairly or unfairly?",
  "options": [
    "Fairly",
    "Unfairly"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the fairness of the upcoming presidential election depends greatly on the country\u2019s electoral processes and transparency. While many countries have taken steps to ensure fairness, issues such as voter suppression, election fraud, or lack of oversight could pose challenges. If the electoral system is well-established, transparent, and properly monitored, I am optimistic about a fair conduct. However, if there are concerns about integrity or irregularities, the election might be perceived as unfair. Given these considerations, I think it\u2019s still uncertain but leaning towards trust in the system if proper measures are maintained.\n\nANSWER: A",
