        "raw_output": "My assessment depends on the policies and actions taken by the Freedom and Justice Party-led government regarding women's rights. If the government advocates for gender equality, promotes women's participation in politics and the workforce, and enforces laws protecting women's rights, I would expect women to have more rights compared to the past. Conversely, if the government enacts restrictive policies or fails to address ongoing gender issues, women could have fewer rights. Without specific information, I believe there is a possibility of maintaining or improving status; hence, the most balanced and cautious view is that women's rights will remain about the same. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe women will have about the same rights under the Freedom and Justice Party-led government as they did in the past. Historically, the party's policies and rhetoric have been seen as cautious or somewhat conservative regarding gender equality initiatives, and there is little evidence to suggest significant progressive advancements in women's rights during its leadership. Therefore, I expect the status quo to largely remain unchanged.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "My sense is that the Freedom and Justice Party-led government may have mixed impacts on women's rights. Depending on its policies, it might promote certain rights but also potentially restrict others, especially if it aligns with conservative values. Therefore, it is difficult to predict a clear shift towards more or fewer rights without specific policy details, but it could be reasonable to assume that the overall level of rights might stay relatively stable if there are no major reforms.\n\nANSWER: C",

Given the cautious and conservative stance often associated with the party, it seems unlikely that there will be substantial advancements or regresses.

Both viewpoints lean toward stability rather than substantial change, and without clear policy moves towards either advancement or restriction, the status quo appears likely to persist.\n\nANSWER: C",
