        "raw_output": "Foreign companies in the oil and petrol industry often operate large-scale operations that require a significant workforce. In many cases, these companies provide employment opportunities for local workers, especially in supporting roles, technical positions, and during the construction and development phases. However, some critics argue that these jobs may not always be accessible to the broader local population or may be limited in number compared to the total labor force. Overall, there is a perception that they do contribute positively to local employment, but the extent and quality of that employment can vary. Considering these factors, I believe they provide jobs for local workers somewhat well. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe foreign companies in the oil and petrol industry in our country do provide some jobs for local workers, but these opportunities might be limited or often favor expatriates or specialists rather than large-scale employment of locals. While they do contribute to employment, the extent to which they do so satisfactorily is uncertain, but it is fair to say they provide jobs to some degree. Therefore, I think \"Somewhat well\" best reflects the situation.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Foreign companies in the oil and petrol industry often bring jobs and economic activity to our country. Many of these companies set up local offices, hire local workers, and contribute to employment rates. However, some people may feel that job opportunities are limited or that the jobs provided are not sufficient to support the local communities fully. Given this mixed perspective, it seems that they generally provide jobs for local workers, but perhaps not to the fullest extent possible. Therefore, I believe they describe this aspect somewhat well.\n\nANSWER: B",

The overall tone indicates a moderate level of contribution to local employment, not a strong or extensive one. Therefore, the best fit is \"Somewhat well,\" as it reflects a mixed but generally positive contribution without implying it is comprehensive or significant.\n\nANSWER: B",

While they do provide some jobs for local workers, these opportunities may be limited in scope and not fully sufficient for the local community's needs.
