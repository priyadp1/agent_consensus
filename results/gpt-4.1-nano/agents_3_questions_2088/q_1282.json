While war is inherently destructive, history has shown that it can sometimes be necessary to correct severe injustices that threaten the well-being of many.

Recognizing the complex nature of justice and conflict, I lean towards somewhat agree because I see the potential necessity in some cases, while also acknowledging the importance of trying to resolve disputes through peaceful channels first.
