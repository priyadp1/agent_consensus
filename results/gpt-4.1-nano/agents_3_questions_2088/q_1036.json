        "raw_output": "I believe the BJP has taken significant steps to combat corruption through initiatives like demonetization, the implementation of GST, and stricter enforcement measures. Their focus on administrative reforms suggests they might be better positioned to address corruption issues. However, the effectiveness of these efforts depends on proper enforcement and long-term commitment. The Congress has historically had its share of corruption allegations, which can impact public trust. Considering these factors, I think the BJP currently appears more active and illustrative in fighting corruption.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "In my opinion, both parties have faced challenges in effectively combating corruption; however, the BJP has made some efforts through initiatives like demonetization and stricter enforcement agencies, whereas the INC has historically been associated with various corruption scandals. Given recent actions and initiatives, I believe the BJP might have a slight edge in this area, but overall, the effectiveness remains debatable. Therefore, I lean towards the BJP in terms of their recent initiatives to fight corruption.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I believe that the BJP has taken concrete steps towards reducing corruption through initiatives like e-governance and crackdown measures, but concerns about transparency persist. The Congress has historically struggled with corruption allegations, although it has also implemented reforms at times. Given the current political environment, I think the BJP might have a slight edge in actively combating corruption. However, corruption is a complex issue that requires sustained efforts from all parties, and no one party has fully eradicated it yet. Therefore, I believe neither party has conclusively demonstrated they can do a significantly better job at this moment.\n\nANSWER: A",
