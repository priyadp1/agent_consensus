  "question": "I'd like your opinion about the effectiveness of different ways of trying to influence what the government does. How effective is it to...participate in an organized protest of any kind...very effective, somewhat effective, not too effective, or not at all effective?",
  "options": [
    "Very effective",
    "Somewhat effective",
    "Not too effective",
    "Not at all effective"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Participating in an organized protest can be a powerful way to demonstrate public concern and mobilize attention around specific issues. Historically, protests have influenced public policy and shifted political priorities, especially when they involve large numbers of participants and sustained effort. While protests alone might not always lead directly to immediate policy changes, they can raise awareness, energize supporters, and create pressure for politicians and decision-makers. Therefore, I believe it is quite effective as a form of activism.\n\nANSWER: A"
