  "options": [
    "Covered fairly",
    "Covered unfairly"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe our country is often covered unfairly in the international news media. This is because mainstream outlets tend to focus on negative aspects, crises, or controversies, which can create a biased or one-sided portrayal. Such coverage may not accurately reflect the country's achievements, contributions, and positive developments, leading to a skewed perception globally. Therefore, I think the coverage tends to be unfair overall.\n\nANSWER: B"
