        "raw_output": "I believe the change in the availability of food in stores is largely due to other reasons rather than just increased global connectivity. Factors such as supply chain disruptions, climate change affecting crop yields, economic shifts, and regional policies can have a more direct impact on food availability. While globalization and international trade do play a role, they are often intertwined with these broader issues. Therefore, I think other reasons are primarily responsible for the current situation.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The change in the availability of food in stores is largely influenced by how the world has become more connected, especially through advances in transportation, global supply chains, and international trade agreements. These connections enable food to be sourced from various parts of the world, increasing variety and availability regardless of local seasonality. While other factors like local policies or climate change also play a role, the interconnectedness of the global economy is the primary driver behind these changes.\n\nANSWER: A",
