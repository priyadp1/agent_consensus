  "question": "Do you think this change in the availability of good-paying jobs is largely because of the way the world has become more connected or mostly for other reasons?",

    "Largely more connected",
    "Other reasons"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the availability of good-paying jobs is influenced by multiple factors, but the increased connectivity of the world plays a significant role. With globalization, markets are more integrated, and opportunities can be accessed across borders, which can both create and eliminate jobs in different sectors. While other reasons such as technological advancements, education levels, and economic policies also matter, the interconnectedness of economies has been a major catalyst in shaping job opportunities worldwide. This global link allows for the rapid spread of industries and skills but can also lead to job displacement in certain areas. Therefore, I think the primary driver is the world's increased connectivity.\n\nANSWER: A",
