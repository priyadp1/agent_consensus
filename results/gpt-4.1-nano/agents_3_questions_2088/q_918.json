        "raw_output": "The statement about most people living in areas where it is dangerous to walk around at night varies greatly depending on the country. In some countries with high crime rates or safety concerns, this may be very well true; in others with strong law enforcement and low crime, it would not be accurate. Without specific context, I believe this description aligns more closely with countries experiencing significant safety issues, but not necessarily universally across all regions. Therefore, I would choose a middle position, considering that safety can differ between urban and rural or affluent and impoverished areas. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "The statement in question suggests that most people in the country face danger when walking at night, implying concerns about safety, crime, or violence in public spaces after dark. Based on general observations and available safety data, in many countries, especially those with higher crime rates, a significant portion of the population perceives walking at night as risky. However, the level of danger varies greatly depending on the country, urban vs. rural areas, and specific local conditions. If my country is known to have issues with crime or insufficient public safety measures, I would consider this statement to describe my country quite well. If it is safer overall, I might lean toward \"somewhat well\" or lower. Given a typical context of concerns about personal safety at night, I would choose:\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The statement describes a concern about safety and crime levels in the country, specifically at night. If crime rates are high, neighborhoods are unsafe, and people often feel threatened walking at night. If the country has low crime rates, most people likely feel secure. Based on general knowledge, many countries struggle with safety issues in certain areas, but not necessarily across all parts. This makes it difficult to say it describes the country very well, but it might be somewhat true. Therefore, I would choose \"somewhat well\" as the most appropriate response, indicating a moderate level of safety concern without it being the dominant perception.\n\nANSWER: B",

If my country has significant safety issues after dark, I would see this statement as describing it very well. Conversely, if my country is generally safe at night, I might consider it only somewhat true. Without knowing specific details about my country, I recognize that concerns about safety at night are common in many places, but not universally true.
