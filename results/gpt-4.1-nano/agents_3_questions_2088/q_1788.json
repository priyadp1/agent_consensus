        "raw_output": "U.S. aid to Egypt historically has been a combination of military assistance and economic aid, but a significant portion has traditionally been allocated towards military support to maintain regional stability and counter extremism. Although the U.S. also provides aid to promote economic development, the scale has often been smaller compared to military aid. Therefore, it leans more towards being mostly military, while still including meaningful economic assistance.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "U.S. aid to Egypt historically includes both military assistance and economic support, but the scale and emphasis have varied over time. Since the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, the U.S. has provided significant military aid to Egypt, particularly for maintaining regional stability and Egypt's role as a strategic partner in the Middle East. At the same time, economic aid has also been given to support development projects, economic reforms, and social programs, but generally on a smaller scale compared to military aid. Overall, military aid has historically been the primary component of U.S. assistance to Egypt, although economic aid remains an important aspect. Therefore, I believe the aid is mostly military.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "The United States provides substantial military aid to Egypt, including advanced weaponry, equipment, and training, which has been a longstanding aspect of their relationship. However, there is also significant economic aid aimed at development projects, infrastructure, and economic reforms to support Egypt's stability and growth. Historically, military aid has generally overshadowed economic aid in terms of sheer volume, but both types play important roles. Given the prominence of military assistance in the overall U.S. aid package to Egypt, I consider it to be mostly military, even though economic aid is also substantial.\n\nANSWER: A",

While economic aid is also provided to support development projects, its scale and emphasis tend to be smaller relative to military aid.
