On one hand, it can lead to strong diplomatic and economic ties, promote cultural exchange, and result in remittances that benefit families and communities back home. On the other hand, a large number of citizens residing abroad might mean a brain drain or loss of workforce, which could hamper economic development. Ultimately, whether this situation is viewed as good or bad depends on the specific context of the country, including its economic conditions, social stability, and how effectively it leverages the benefits of its diaspora. For many, the connection to citizens abroad is a source of pride and opportunity, making the overall impact more positive.\n\nANSWER: A",
