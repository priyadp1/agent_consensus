  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe the most important reason Islam is playing a greater role in politics today is due to concerns about Western influence in our country. This concern often fuels the desire to uphold traditional Islamic values and resist cultural or political pressures from Western countries, which many see as threatening to their identity and moral fabric. While dissatisfaction with the government and societal immorality are significant factors, the apprehension about Western influence tends to be a primary motivator for increased political activity rooted in Islamic principles.\n\nANSWER: C"
