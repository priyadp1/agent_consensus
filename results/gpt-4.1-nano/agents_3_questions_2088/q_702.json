While he also advocates for unity and development, the overall impression from various public responses and analyses indicates that he is perceived by many as a figure who stirs strong opinions, sometimes leading to social divides.

        "raw_output": "My impression of Narendra Modi is that he tends to be perceived as a leader who emphasizes national pride and unity, but his political actions and speeches sometimes also foster division among different groups based on religion, caste, or regional identities. Depending on individual perspectives and the context, some may see him as someone who unites people, especially those who share his ideological stance, while others view him as a divisive figure who exacerbates social and communal divides. Given the complexity of his leadership style, I lean toward the view that he brings people together in some contexts but is also perceived by many as divisive in others. Therefore, I consider that he could be seen as someone who is divisive, but the impression varies among different observers.\n\nANSWER: B",
