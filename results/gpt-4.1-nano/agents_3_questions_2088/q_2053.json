This suggests that I occasionally find myself unable to stop, but not always to a severe extent.

Even when I recognize that an action is wrong, I might find myself acting impulsively. Therefore, I would choose a mid-range option indicating a moderate tendency to act against my better judgment, but not all the time.

While I do manage to control myself most of the time, there are moments where I struggle to stop myself. This feels moderate in intensity, not completely losing control, but certainly not easy.

While I can usually control myself, there are moments when I struggle to stop. This reflects a moderate tendency to act impulsively without losing complete control, but not to the extent of acting without any restraint.

While I am aware that some of my actions may be wrong, I find it challenging to always stop myself in these situations, indicating a moderate to high level of impulsivity.
