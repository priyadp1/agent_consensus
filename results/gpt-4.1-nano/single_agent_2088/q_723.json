  "question": "Overall, how much influence do you think China is having on the way things are going in our country? Would you say it is having a great deal of influence, a fair amount, not too much, or no influence at all? (Ask if 'A great deal' or 'A fair amount':) Is this a good thing, a bad thing, or neither good nor bad?",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad",
    "Neither"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe China's influence on our country is moderate, and whether this is good or bad depends on the specific areas affected. A considerable influence can sometimes be beneficial if it promotes positive economic or diplomatic relationships, but it can also pose risks if it affects our sovereignty or values negatively. Therefore, I think the influence is neither inherently good nor bad without context.\n\nANSWER: C"
