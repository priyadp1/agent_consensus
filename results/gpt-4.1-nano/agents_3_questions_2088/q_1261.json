        "raw_output": "The perception of the European Union's efficiency varies among individuals based on factors such as governance, economic policies, and effectiveness in addressing member states' needs. Some may see its decision-making process as slow and bureaucratic, leading to perceptions of inefficiency. Others might believe that its structure allows for broad cooperation, which is inherently complex but necessary for large-scale governance. Given these perspectives, I lean towards viewing the EU as having inefficiencies, though it may also be effective in certain areas. Therefore, I select option A.\n\nANSWER: A",
