        "raw_output": "The characteristic \"arrogant\" is a negative stereotype that may be associated with some perceptions of the Japanese, but generally, such stereotypes can be influenced by cultural misunderstandings and are not accurate reflections of individuals. While some might mistakenly associate arrogance with cultural pride or confidence, others recognize the Japanese culture as respectful and humble. Given the tendency to avoid attributing negative traits broadly, I would lean towards thinking that most people do not associate arrogance with the Japanese. Therefore, I choose not to associate this characteristic.\n\nANSWER: B",
