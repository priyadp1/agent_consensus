Question 1
Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of ____. b. Moderate Party

I would say I have a somewhat favorable opinion of the Moderate Party. 

My reasoning is that the Moderate Party, being a center-right political party in Sweden, tends to promote economic stability, market-oriented policies, and fiscal responsibility, which are generally positive qualities. While I may not agree with all their policies or strategies, I appreciate their efforts to balance economic growth with social stability. Therefore, "somewhat favorable" seems like a balanced assessment based on their typical political stance and influence.
