        "raw_output": "China is often criticized for its strict government control and limited individual freedoms, especially in areas such as free speech, political expression, and assembly. While the government emphasizes stability and economic development, many reports and international assessments suggest that personal freedoms are restricted, and citizens have limited rights to express dissent or participate freely in political processes. Therefore, it is generally believed that the government does not fully respect the personal freedoms of its people.\n\nANSWER: B",
