  "question": "Do you favor or oppose the following? Giving Muslim leaders and religious judges the power to decide family and property disputes.",
  "options": [
    "Favor",
    "Oppose"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Allowing Muslim leaders and religious judges to decide family and property disputes could have both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, religious leaders often have deep knowledge of religious laws and cultural norms, which might lead to more culturally sensitive decisions. On the other hand, this arrangement could raise concerns about fairness, secular legal standards, and consistency in justice. The decision to support or oppose depends on balancing respect for religious authority with the importance of impartial legal processes. Given the potential risks of bias or marginalization, I lean toward opposition to ensure equal treatment under a neutral legal system.\n\nANSWER: B",
