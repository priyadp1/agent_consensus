    "Both (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons is more important because nuclear proliferation increases global security threats and risks of nuclear escalation. While avoiding military conflict is desirable, the potential consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran\u2014such as regional instability or nuclear proliferation\u2014are more concerning in the long term. Therefore, taking decisive action to prevent nuclear development aligns with maintaining international security, even if it involves military measures.\n\nANSWER: A",
