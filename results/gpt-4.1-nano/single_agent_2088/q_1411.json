  "raw_output": "Increased trade with China could bring economic benefits such as access to a larger market, competitive goods, and potential job growth. However, it also raises concerns about dependency, trade imbalances, and the impact on domestic industries. On balance, if managed carefully, increased trade could be somewhat good for our country by fostering economic growth and international cooperation, while also requiring safeguards to address risks. Therefore, I believe it would be somewhat good.\n\nANSWER: B",
