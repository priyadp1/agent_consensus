  "question": "As I read a list of groups and organizations, for each, please tell me what kind of influence the group is having on the way things are going in your country. Is the influence of the current government in Kiev very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad or very bad in your country? ",
  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat bad",
    "Very bad"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The influence of the current government in Kiev on my country is somewhat bad because while there have been some efforts towards reform and stability, ongoing conflicts, corruption issues, and economic challenges have hindered positive progress. Many citizens feel that the government\u2019s actions have not sufficiently improved the situation, and in some cases, it has contributed to increased tensions and uncertainty. Therefore, I believe the influence is closer to negative than positive. \n\nANSWER: C",
