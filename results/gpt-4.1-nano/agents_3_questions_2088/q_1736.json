        "raw_output": "I believe that the spread of nuclear weapons poses the greatest threat to the world because it has the potential for catastrophic consequences on a global scale. The use of nuclear weapons could lead to mass destruction, long-lasting environmental damage, and widespread loss of life. Unlike other issues, which are serious but more manageable or localized, nuclear proliferation increases the risk of conflict escalating into a nuclear war, which could threaten human civilization itself. Ensuring that nuclear weapons are controlled and nuclear proliferation is prevented is critical for global security and stability.\n\nANSWER: A",

Nuclear proliferation has the potential to cause catastrophic destruction and human suffering on an unprecedented scale. If nuclear weapons fall into the wrong hands or are used in conflicts, the consequences could be global in scope, including long-term environmental damage and widespread loss of life. While other issues are pressing, the destructive capacity and potential for global annihilation make nuclear proliferation the most immediate and severe threat to international stability and peace.\n\nANSWER: A",
