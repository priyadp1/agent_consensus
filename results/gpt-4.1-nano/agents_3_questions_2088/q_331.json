        "raw_output": "The perception of Russia internationally regarding President Putin\u2019s handling of the Ukraine situation varies among different countries. In some nations, increased sanctions, diplomatic conflicts, and media coverage have likely fostered a more negative view of Russia, leading many to have a less favorable opinion. Conversely, other groups may see Russia\u2019s actions as a stance against Western influence or may sympathize with certain narratives, potentially bolstering a more favorable view. Overall, the prevailing international sentiment tends to lean toward a less favorable opinion because many countries and their populations respond negatively to military conflicts and geopolitical tensions, especially when those actions lead to international condemnation or economic repercussions.\n\nANSWER: B",
