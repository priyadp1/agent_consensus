        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The perception of the U.S. by other countries following Joe Biden's presidency is likely influenced by various factors such as diplomatic efforts, policy changes, and international events. Many countries hoped that Biden's approach would restore traditional alliances and improve America's image after a period of turbulence. While some nations may view this change positively, others might remain skeptical or cautious, especially if previous actions or ongoing conflicts continue to influence perceptions. Overall, the shift in leadership might lead to a modest improvement in views, but it is unlikely to be seen as a significant or sweeping change by most countries. Therefore, the most reasonable assumption is that they see a slight improvement in perceptions.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The perception of the U.S. by other countries under Joe Biden\u2019s presidency may be somewhat more positive due to his emphasis on restoring alliances and diplomatic efforts. Many recent international surveys suggest that Biden's approach has improved the U.S.'s image in some parts of the world, although perceptions vary depending on region and specific issues. However, the change is likely to be moderate rather than drastically positive or negative, as global opinions are influenced by complex factors beyond the current administration's policies. Therefore, I believe the most accurate choice reflects a slight shift towards a more positive view.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The perception of how other countries view the U.S. since Joe Biden became president is complex and varies by region and diplomatic history. Some nations may view the change in leadership as a positive shift, especially if they associate Biden with a return to more traditional diplomacy and multilateral cooperation, which could lead to more positive opinions, even if only slightly. Others may remain skeptical or unchanged in their perceptions due to longstanding geopolitical issues or domestic policies. Overall, the consensus among some international observers suggests a modest improvement rather than a dramatic shift, which aligns with a \"a little more positively\" outlook. \n\nANSWER: B",
