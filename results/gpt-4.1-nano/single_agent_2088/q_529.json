  "raw_output": "The effectiveness of the United Nations in dealing with international problems is often debated. Critics argue that it can be hindered by geopolitical interests and bureaucracy, leading to limited or slow responses in crises. Supporters, however, believe it provides a vital platform for dialogue and coordination among nations, which can lead to solutions that might not be possible otherwise. Considering these perspectives, the actual effectiveness varies depending on the specific issue and context. Given the complex and often mixed record, I believe the United Nations does not always deal effectively with international problems.\n\nANSWER: B"
