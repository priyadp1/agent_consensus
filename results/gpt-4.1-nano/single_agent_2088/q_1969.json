  "question": "As I read a list of groups and organizations, please tell me how good a job each has done in responding to the impact of the March 11th earthquake and tsunami...Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)",
  "options": [
    "Very good",
    "Somewhat good",
    "Somewhat poor",
    "Very poor"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "TEPCO was heavily criticized for its initial response, handling of the disaster, and transparency during the crisis. Many people believe that their efforts in managing the Fukushima nuclear accident were insufficient and that they failed to communicate effectively with the public and authorities. While they eventually took measures to stabilize the situation, the perceived shortcomings of their early response and ongoing issues have lasting impacts on public trust. Therefore, I would choose a more negative assessment.\n\nANSWER: D",
