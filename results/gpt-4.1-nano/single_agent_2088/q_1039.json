  "raw_output": "The US led war against terrorism has aimed to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent future attacks. However, some people believe that such military interventions may also create power vacuums or fuel anti-American sentiments, potentially leading to increased threats. While some advancements in security measures have likely reduced the chances, the complexity of terrorism means the risk may not have significantly decreased or could even have risen. Therefore, it's reasonable to think the perceived risk remains about the same as before.\n\nANSWER: C",
