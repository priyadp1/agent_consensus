        "raw_output": "I believe the influence of the People's Assembly is somewhat bad, as in many countries, such organizations often face challenges such as limited power, political opposition, or internal disagreements that hinder their ability to positively impact national progress. Their influence may be perceived as not sufficiently constructive or might even contribute to instability, depending on the context. Therefore, I see their effect as having some negative implications for the country's development.\n\nANSWER: C",
