  "question": "Thinking about the economic consequences of the [insert local term for coronavirus outbreak], have the European Union\u2019s economic relief efforts gone too far, not gone far enough or been about right?",
  "options": [
    "Gone too far",
    "Not gone far enough",
    "Been about right",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the EU\u2019s economic relief efforts have not gone far enough because the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak continues to affect many citizens and businesses, and more support is necessary to ensure a full recovery and prevent long-term damage. Without sufficient intervention, economic disparities could worsen, and recovery may be slowed. Therefore, additional measures are warranted to address these ongoing challenges.\n\nANSWER: B"
