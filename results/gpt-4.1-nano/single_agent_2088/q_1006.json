  "raw_output": "China has been known to engage in various efforts to influence other countries' internal affairs, including diplomatic, economic, and sometimes political activities aimed at shaping foreign policies or public opinion in its favor. While it also participates in international cooperation and maintains a focus on sovereignty, its assertive actions in certain regions suggest that it actively seeks to extend its influence rather than predominantly avoiding involvement. Therefore, many people would perceive China as trying to influence the internal affairs of other countries rather than mostly staying out of them.\n\nANSWER: A",
