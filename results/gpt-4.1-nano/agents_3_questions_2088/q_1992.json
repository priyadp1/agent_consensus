While it is an active member of the European Union and often promotes diplomatic solutions and cooperation, it has also taken stances that show a degree of influence and involvement in regional and global matters. Germany's policies tend to favor multilateralism and respect for sovereignty, but it does participate in actions like peacekeeping missions and diplomatic initiatives that suggest it does not completely stay out of other countries' internal affairs. However, compared to more interventionist nations, Germany generally aims to minimize direct interference, focusing instead on influence through diplomacy and development aid.\n\nANSWER: B",
