  "question": "What's your opinion of U.S. policies in the Middle East - would you say they are fair or do they favor Israel too much or do they favor the Palestinians too much?",
  "options": [
    "Fair",
    "Favor Israel",
    "Favor Palestinians"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The U.S. policies in the Middle East often reflect complex geopolitical interests, historical alliances, and strategic considerations. While the U.S. has historically been a strong supporter of Israel, this has sometimes led to perceptions that these policies favor Israel more than the Palestinians. At the same time, the U.S. has engaged in efforts to support Palestinian statehood and peace initiatives. Overall, many view the policies as leaning toward favoring one side over the other, rather than maintaining a balanced approach. Given this context, I believe the policies tend to favor Israel more than the Palestinians.\n\nANSWER: B"
