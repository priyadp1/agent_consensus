  "question": "Some countries have decided to ban the wearing of 'Burqa' by Muslim women in public places including schools. Do you think this is a good idea or a bad idea?",
  "options": [
    "Good idea",
    "Bad idea"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe banning the wearing of the burqa in public places and schools is a bad idea because it restricts individual freedom of religious expression and can lead to discrimination against Muslim women. Such measures may also foster social division rather than promote understanding and tolerance. Respecting religious diversity while ensuring public safety and social cohesion should be balanced without outright bans. \n\nANSWER: B"
