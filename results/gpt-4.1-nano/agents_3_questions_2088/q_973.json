For some, fidelity is a key moral value, making such affairs morally unacceptable; for others, circumstances such as emotional needs or personal freedom might influence their judgment. Therefore, it seems subjective and situational, and I do not think it is a clear-cut moral issue that applies universally. \n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "I believe that whether a married person having an affair is morally acceptable or unacceptable can vary greatly depending on individual values, cultural norms, and circumstances. For some, fidelity is a core moral principle, making such an affair morally unacceptable. Others might consider situations like emotional needs or personal growth, and thus see the morality as situational. Given the complexity and diversity of opinions, I think it's best to acknowledge that it can depend on the specific situation.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "I believe that married people having an affair is morally unacceptable because it breaches the trust and commitment inherent in a marital relationship. Such actions can cause harm and suffering to all involved parties, undermining the moral foundation of loyalty and honesty that is essential in marriage.
