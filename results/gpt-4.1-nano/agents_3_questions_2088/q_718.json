        "raw_output": "I believe that what happens in other European Union countries can influence my personal economic situation to a fair amount because economic developments, trade relations, and policies within the EU often have ripple effects across member states. Changes such as economic growth or downturns in neighboring countries can impact job markets, stability, and prices domestically. While the direct influence may not be as strong as domestic factors, the interconnected nature of the EU economy means that developments elsewhere do have a discernible effect on my financial well-being.\n\nANSWER: B",

Events such as economic crises, political shifts, or policy changes in other member states can have ripple effects on the entire region, including my own country. Therefore, what happens in other EU countries impacts me to a fair amount, but not necessarily to a great deal, since there are also national factors at play that directly affect my economic well-being.\n\nANSWER: B",
