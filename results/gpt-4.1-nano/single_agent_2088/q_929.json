  "question": "I am going to read you the same list.  Does people have access to the internet without government censorship or interference describe our country very well, somewhat well, not too well or not well at all?   ",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The level of access to the internet without government censorship or interference varies greatly depending on the country in question. In some nations, there is relatively open access with minimal restrictions, allowing people to freely browse and share information. In others, government control and censorship severely limit what content is accessible, hindering free expression and access. Given the general global trends toward increased regulation and censorship in various regions, it seems that our country does not provide full or very open access to the internet without interference. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that the access is somewhat limited or not very well facilitated. \n\nANSWER: B",
