  "question": "In your opinion, does the continued building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank help the security of Israel, hurt the security of Israel, or does it not make a difference? ",
  "options": [
    "Helps the security of Israel",
    "Hurts the security of Israel",
    "Does not make a difference"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The continued building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank is a complex issue with arguments on both sides. Some argue that settlements provide strategic depth and security buffers, thereby enhancing Israel\u2019s security. Others contend that settlement expansion inflames tensions, undermines peace efforts, and invites hostility from Palestinians and the broader Arab world, ultimately impairing security. Additionally, ongoing settlement activity can complicate peace negotiations and fuel unrest, which may threaten long-term stability rather than improve it. Therefore, it is difficult to see the settlements as solely beneficial or harmful without considering the broader political context.\n\nANSWER: C",
