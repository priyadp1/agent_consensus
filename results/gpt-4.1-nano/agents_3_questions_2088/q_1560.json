        "raw_output": "The United States and its allies have significant influence and resources that can be effective in stabilizing Iraq through diplomatic, military, and economic support. However, their involvement might also trigger nationalist sentiments or perceptions of external interference. The United Nations, on the other hand, has a reputation for neutrality and multilateral diplomacy, which can facilitate broader cooperation among Iraqi factions and promote inclusive governance. Ideally, a collaborative approach involving both entities would be most effective, but if I must choose, the UN's neutrality and emphasis on international cooperation could better foster sustainable stability. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe the United Nations could do the best job at helping the Iraqi people form a stable government because it is a neutral international organization with experience in mediating in complex political situations and promoting diplomatic solutions. Its focus on multilateral cooperation can help build inclusive governance and foster trust among diverse Iraqi factions, which is essential for long-term stability. While the United States and its allies have considerable influence, their interests might be viewed as more self-interested or partisan, potentially complicating efforts to establish a balanced and inclusive government.
