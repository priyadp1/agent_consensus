        "raw_output": "My unfavorable view of the United States stems from a combination of factors, including specific policies and actions associated with President George W. Bush, such as the Iraq War and issues related to foreign policy and interventionism. However, I also perceive broader structural and cultural issues within the country, like inequality, domestic politics, and international reputation, contributing to my overall perspective. Since the question asks whether the negativity is mainly due to Bush or a larger problem with America, I see it as more of a shared problem that cannot be solely attributed to one individual or moment. Therefore, I believe that it's more accurate to consider it a general problem with America rather than attributing it primarily to Bush.\n\nANSWER: C",
