        "raw_output": "I believe that the decision about international trade agreements should typically be made by the European Union because trade policies are often better managed through a collective regional approach, which can foster uniformity, strengthen bargaining power, and ensure that member countries' interests are aligned. This helps to create a more cohesive economic zone and can protect against individual countries making potentially conflicting agreements. Therefore, I think the EU should make decisions in this area.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that international trade agreements are often complex and involve multiple countries and regions. Given the interconnected nature of global markets, it seems more appropriate for the EU to make decisions on this issue since it functions as a unified economic entity representing multiple nations, which can negotiate and enforce trade agreements more effectively than individual countries acting alone. This helps ensure consistency across member states and allows for stronger negotiation power internationally. Therefore, I think the EU should make decisions regarding international trade agreements.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe that my country's government should have the primary authority to make decisions about international trade agreements because they understand local economic needs and can negotiate in the best interest of the nation. However, given the interconnected nature of global markets, collaboration with the EU can ensure that trade policies are harmonized and beneficial across borders. Therefore, a combined decision-making approach involving both my country and the EU could be ideal, but ultimately, national sovereignty should take precedence in such critical economic matters. \n\nANSWER: C",
