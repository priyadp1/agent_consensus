  "question": "Now I am going to read you a list of things that may be problems in our country.  As I read each one, please tell me if you think it is a very big problem, a moderately big problem, a small problem or not a problem at all...the conflict between the civilian government and the judiciary",
  "options": [
    "Very big problem",
    "Moderately big problem",
    "Small problem",
    "Not a problem at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The conflict between the civilian government and the judiciary can undermine the rule of law and democratic stability if it escalates, but in many cases, it remains a managed or limited issue that does not significantly threaten overall governance. Therefore, considering its potential to cause unrest or instability, I believe it is a moderately significant problem, but not necessarily one that threatens the entire country\u2019s functioning on its own.\n\nANSWER: B",
