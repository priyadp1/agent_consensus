        "raw_output": "If robots and computers take over much of the work done by humans, it could lead to increased inequality because the benefits of automation might primarily accrue to the wealthy or those who own the technology, while many workers could face unemployment or reduced wages. This disparity could deepen existing economic divides, especially if social safety nets and redistribution policies are not in place. Therefore, I believe it is likely that inequality between rich and poor would become much worse.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "If robots and computers take over a significant portion of human work, there is a concern that economic inequality could worsen, as the benefits of automation might accrue mainly to the owners of technology and capital. This could lead to a wider gap between the wealthy and the poor, especially if measures are not taken to ensure fair distribution of resources or to support those displaced by automation.

This is because technology tends to benefit those with the resources to develop and access it, often further enriching the already wealthy while leaving lower-income populations behind.
