        "raw_output": "Many people believe that Japan has made significant efforts to apologize for its actions during World War II, including formal apologies and expressions of remorse. However, some feel that these apologies have been insufficient or inconsistent over time, leading to ongoing tensions and perceptions of a lack of genuine remorse. Others argue that as time has passed, further apologies may not be necessary, especially if current governments are progressing in reconciliation and relations. Considering these perspectives, I believe that Japan has not apologized sufficiently, as lingering distrust and unresolved issues indicate that more meaningful action or acknowledgment might still be needed to fully address past actions.\n\nANSWER: B",
