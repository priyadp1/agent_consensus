  "options": [
    "Very important",
    "Somewhat important",
    "Not too important",
    "Not at all important",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Some people might be unmotivated or lazy, but this reason doesn't fully capture the broader social or economic factors influencing unemployment. While motivation can play a role, other issues like skill mismatch, economic downturn, or lack of opportunities are often more significant. Therefore, considering the complexity of unemployment causes, I think this is only a somewhat important reason rather than very important. \n\nANSWER: B"
