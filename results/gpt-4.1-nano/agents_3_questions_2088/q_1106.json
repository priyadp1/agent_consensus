Advances in technology, artificial intelligence, and automation are progressing rapidly, making it highly feasible that many jobs can be automated or assisted by machines. While some jobs may remain human-centric due to complexity, emotional intelligence, or ethical considerations, the overall trend suggests a significant shift toward automation. Therefore, I see this as something likely to happen, though perhaps not with absolute certainty. \n\nANSWER: B",

Technological advancements in artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics are progressing rapidly, making it increasingly feasible for machines to handle complex and routine work. While some jobs may remain inherently human, the trend suggests a significant shift toward automation across multiple industries. Therefore, I think it is probably going to happen, but there might still be some uncertainties and transitions involved.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe it is likely that in the next 50 years, robots and computers will perform much of the work currently done by humans. Advances in artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics have been rapid, leading to increased capabilities in various industries such as manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, and services. While some jobs may be resistant to automation, it is reasonable to think that a significant portion of the workforce will be replaced or augmented by machines over this time span, especially considering historical trends of technological progress and productivity gains. Therefore, I lean towards the view that this transformation is probable, though not absolutely certain.\n\nANSWER: B",
