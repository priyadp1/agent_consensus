        "raw_output": "I believe trade unions pose no significant threat to the country's economic well-being because they primarily focus on advocating for workers' rights and better conditions, which can contribute to a more motivated and productive workforce. While there may be concerns about potential disruptions due to strikes or collective bargaining, evidence suggests that when balanced effectively, trade unions help stabilize labor markets rather than destabilize the economy. Therefore, I see them more as a factor that promotes fairness rather than an economic threat.\n\nANSWER: C",

These factors might influence economic efficiency and competitiveness negatively if not managed properly. However, their overall impact is often manageable and can even be beneficial when balancing the interests of employees and employers.
