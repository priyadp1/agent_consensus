  "options": [
    "Strong ties with the United States",
    "Strong ties with Russia",
    "Equally close ties with both the U.S. and Russia (VOL)",
    "Neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Germany's geopolitical and economic stability largely depends on its relationships with major global powers. The United States has historically been a key ally, security partner, and trading partner, especially within NATO and in promoting democratic values. Strong ties with the U.S. support Germany's defense, innovation, and its leadership role within Western institutions. While Russia is a significant neighbor and energy supplier, reliance on Russia poses geopolitical risks and complicates Germany's stance on security and democracy. Therefore, maintaining robust relations with the U.S. is generally more beneficial for Germany's long-term stability, security, and prosperity.\n\nANSWER: A"
