        "raw_output": "I believe China is doing a somewhat bad job dealing with global climate change. Although the country has made some efforts to invest in renewable energy and reduce emissions, it remains the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and has been criticized for not implementing more aggressive policies. The level of progress is hindered by reliance on coal and rapid economic growth, which complicates efforts to address climate change effectively. Therefore, I would rate their efforts as somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe China is doing a somewhat bad job dealing with global climate change. While China has made some commitments to reduce emissions and invest in renewable energy, it continues to rely heavily on coal and other fossil fuels, which are significant contributors to greenhouse gases. Additionally, its rapid economic growth and urbanization often outpace environmental policies, leading to increased pollution and environmental challenges. Overall, China's efforts are not sufficient to address the scale and urgency of climate change effectively, and there is considerable room for improvement.\n\nANSWER: C",

While the country has made some commitments to reduce emissions and invest in renewable energy, it remains the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and continues to expand fossil fuel use and industrial activity. This inconsistency between efforts and ongoing practices makes its overall performance appear less effective in addressing climate change globally.\n\nANSWER: C",

Despite some efforts to reduce emissions and promote renewable energy, China continues to rely heavily on coal and fossil fuels, and its rapid economic growth often undermines environmental initiatives.

While the country has invested in renewable energy and made some commitments to reduce emissions, it still relies heavily on coal and continues rapid economic growth, which often takes precedence over environmental policies.
