Some analysts believe that Iran aims to develop nuclear weapons for strategic and deterrence purposes in a complex regional security environment. Simultaneously, Iran has also emphasized the importance of nuclear energy for civilian purposes, such as power generation and economic development, especially given its needs for energy independence and diversification. While both factors might influence Iran's nuclear ambitions, the desire for energy security and the peaceful use of nuclear technology appear to be primary motivations highlighted publicly. Therefore, the most fitting choice that acknowledges both aspects is that Iran's nuclear program stems from both intentions.\n\nANSWER: C",
