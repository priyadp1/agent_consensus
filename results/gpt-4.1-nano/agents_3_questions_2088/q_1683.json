        "raw_output": "Allowing individuals to express themselves openly is important for free speech and open discourse. However, when statements are offensive to someone's religion or beliefs, they can cause significant harm and social division. While freedom of speech is fundamental, there are circumstances where restrictions may be necessary to prevent harm or protect social harmony. Balancing these considerations, I believe that a nuanced approach should be taken, but generally, people should have the space to express themselves unless it causes undue harm or incites violence. Therefore, I support the idea that people should be able to say these things publicly.\n\nANSWER: A",
