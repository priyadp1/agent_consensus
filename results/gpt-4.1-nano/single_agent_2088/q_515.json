  "question": "When there are differences between our country and the United States, do you think these differences occur because we have different values than the United States or because we have different policies than the United States?",
  "options": [
    "Different Values",
    "Different Policies",
    "Both (Values/Policies)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that many differences between our country and the United States stem from underlying values, such as cultural beliefs, social priorities, and worldviews, which influence attitudes and behaviors more deeply than policy changes alone. While policies can vary and be adjusted more readily, they often reflect the core values held by a society. Therefore, it seems that differing values are a fundamental reason for the differences observed. \n\nANSWER: A"
