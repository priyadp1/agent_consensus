Negotiations can lead to peaceful agreements and international recognition, fostering stability and cooperation. Nonviolent resistance can raise awareness, build international support, and demonstrate the desire for peace without violence. While armed struggle might have historically played a role, it often results in continued conflict and suffering, and may hinder long-term prospects for peace. Therefore, a combination of negotiations and nonviolent resistance appears to be the most sustainable and effective path forward, promoting dialogue, understanding, and peaceful progress.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "In my view, a sustainable path toward Palestinian statehood is most likely to be achieved through a combination of these approaches. While negotiations provide a diplomatic framework for peaceful resolution and building mutual understanding, incorporating nonviolent resistance can maintain pressure and mobilize international support. At the same time, having parallel means to assert rights and defend interests, including some form of controlled resistance, may be necessary given the complexities on the ground. Relying solely on one method might limit the chances of success, but an integrated approach can adapt to changing circumstances and foster both political progress and local resilience.\n\nANSWER: D",

Negotiations provide a platform for diplomatic engagement and can secure internationally recognized agreements, fostering stability and coexistence. While armed struggle and violence tend to lead to cycles of conflict and suffering, nonviolent resistance has historically proven effective in mobilizing popular support, gaining moral high ground, and pressuring governments to change policies. Combining diplomatic negotiations with nonviolent resistance efforts can create a comprehensive strategy that emphasizes peaceful progress and international cooperation, making the pursuit of statehood more attainable and sustainable.\n\nANSWER: D",
