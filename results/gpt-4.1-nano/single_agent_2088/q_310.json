  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I tend to trust European standards more for environmental safety because the European Union has a long-standing reputation for strict environmental regulations and comprehensive sustainability policies. Their standards often prioritize precautionary principles and involve extensive testing and oversight, which gives me more confidence that products and services meet high environmental safety criteria. While American standards also have their merits, I perceive European standards as more rigorous in environmental matters.\n\nANSWER: A"
