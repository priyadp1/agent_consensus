  "question": "Do you think the Pakistani government knew Osama bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad, or don't you think so?",
  "options": [
    "Yes, knew he was in Abbottabad",
    "No, did not know he was in Abbottabad"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "There is widespread speculation and evidence suggesting that the Pakistani government had some level of knowledge about Osama bin Laden's location, given the complex diplomatic and intelligence environment. However, official claims have often denied direct knowledge, leading to uncertainty. Considering the available information and the political complexities involved, it's plausible that some elements within the government might have had awareness, even if they did not officially acknowledge it. Therefore, I believe the government may have known he was hiding in Abbottabad.\n\nANSWER: A"
