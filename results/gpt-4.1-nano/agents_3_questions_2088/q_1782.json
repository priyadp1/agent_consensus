        "raw_output": "Promoting and defending human rights in other countries is an important aspect of responsible international leadership, but it must often be balanced against national interests, economic considerations, and diplomatic relationships. Therefore, assigning it the highest priority may overlook practical constraints, while ignoring it altogether risks neglecting fundamental moral principles. A moderate approach that recognizes its importance but does not overshadow other long-term goals seems most reasonable. Hence, I believe it should be given some priority.\n\nANSWER: B",

However, given limited resources and competing priorities in foreign policy, it might not always warrant the highest level of focus compared to other strategic interests such as security or economic development. Therefore, I believe it should be given some priority, enough to influence policies and aid, but not necessarily the topmost priority.\n\nANSWER: B",
