  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that birth control and family planning have generally been a change for the better because they allow individuals to make more choices about their reproductive health, contribute to reducing unintended pregnancies, and improve women's rights and overall well-being. These options enable families to plan their futures more effectively and lead to healthier, more stable communities.
