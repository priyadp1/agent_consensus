  "question": "Thinking about the future, if you had to choose, which of the following scenarios would be better for the world?",
  "options": [
    "The U.S. is the world\u2019s leading power",
    "China is the world\u2019s leading power",
    "Both (DO NOT READ)",

    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "My choice is based on the potential stability and global influence of a single dominant power, whether it is the U.S. or China. A clear leadership might streamline international decision-making, reduce conflicts arising from power struggles, and promote coordinated efforts to address global issues such as climate change, health crises, and economic stability. However, it is also important to consider that shared leadership or multipolarity could foster diverse perspectives and balanced influence. Given the options, a single dominant power might lead to clearer policies and accountability, which could be advantageous for the world's future stability.\n\nANSWER: A"
