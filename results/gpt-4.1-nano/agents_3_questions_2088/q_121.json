Given the complex political dynamics and ongoing protests, these tensions can sometimes escalate and impact broader U.S. interests, such as trade and international security. While they may not always be seen as the top global issue, they remain a source of concern that warrants attention. Therefore, I believe it is a somewhat serious problem for the U.S.\n\nANSWER: B",

Such tensions can influence stability, economic relations, and international diplomacy, potentially posing serious challenges for the U.S. in terms of security and policy. While the direct impact on everyday Americans may not always be immediately apparent, the broader geopolitical consequences make this a noteworthy and somewhat serious concern.
