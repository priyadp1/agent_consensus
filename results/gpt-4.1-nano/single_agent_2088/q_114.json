  "question": "If Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, do you think they would be likely to...use them for defensive purposes only, or not?",
  "options": [
    "Yes, likely",
    "No, not likely"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Given Iran's regional tensions and concerns about its military ambitions, even if it develops nuclear weapons, there's skepticism about them being used solely for defensive purposes. Historically, nuclear-armed states sometimes consider using their weapons for deterrence, but the possibility of them being used offensively or preemptively cannot be ignored. Therefore, while Iran might claim they would only use nuclear weapons defensively, international perceptions and strategic uncertainties make it unlikely that they would restrict their use to solely defensive purposes.\n\nANSWER: B"
