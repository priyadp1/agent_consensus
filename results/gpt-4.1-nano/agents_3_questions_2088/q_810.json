        "raw_output": "India's relationship with China is complex, influenced by both cooperation and competition. On the one hand, India and China are major economic powers in Asia, engaging in trade, infrastructure projects, and diplomatic dialogues. On the other hand, they have significant territorial disputes, border conflicts, and strategic rivalries, especially in the Indo-Pacific region. While they collaborate on some multilateral issues, mistrust remains due to past conflicts and regional ambitions. Overall, the relationship seems to be more nuanced than purely friendly or adversarial, but given the lingering disputes and competition, I see India as more of an enemy than a partner in the current context.\n\nANSWER: B",

While both countries engage in trade and diplomatic efforts, longstanding border disputes, strategic competition, and regional rivalries also define their interactions.
