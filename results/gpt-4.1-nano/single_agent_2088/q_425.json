  "question": "Overall, do you think women will have more rights, fewer rights, or about the same rights under the Ennahda Party-led government as they had in the past? ",
  "options": [
    "More rights",
    "Fewer rights",
    "About the same"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe women will have about the same rights under the Ennahda Party-led government as they had in the past. This is because, historically, Ennahda's approach has been relatively moderate and focused on balancing religious values with modern societal norms, which suggests that significant changes in women's rights are unlikely in the current political context. Additionally, ongoing social and political factors tend to maintain the status quo rather than lead to major shifts in gender equality policies.\n\nANSWER: C"
