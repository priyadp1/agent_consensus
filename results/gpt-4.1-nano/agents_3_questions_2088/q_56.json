        "raw_output": "If robots and computers take over much of the work currently done by humans, it is plausible that many ordinary people might find it more difficult to secure jobs, especially in sectors where automation could replace human labor. This concern is common in discussions about technological unemployment, as job displacement due to automation can lead to increased competition for the remaining jobs, which may require new skills that not everyone has yet acquired. Therefore, I believe it is likely that ordinary people would have a hard time finding jobs as a result of widespread automation.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "If robots and computers take over many jobs currently done by humans, it is reasonable to think that many ordinary people could struggle to find new employment opportunities. Automation often reduces the availability of traditional jobs, especially for those with skills that are easily replaceable by machines, leading to increased unemployment or underemployment. Therefore, it is likely that many individuals would face difficulty securing jobs in such a scenario. \n\nANSWER: A",

This could lead to higher unemployment rates and economic challenges for everyday workers, as the job market adjusts to technological changes. Given these considerations, I believe it is likely that ordinary people would have a hard time finding jobs as a result of such automation.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that if robots and computers handle much of the current human work, it would be quite likely that many ordinary people would have a hard time finding jobs. Automation has a tendency to replace certain types of jobs, especially those involving routine or manual tasks, which can lead to increased unemployment or difficulty in finding new employment for those whose skills are no longer in demand. While some new opportunities might emerge in other sectors, the overall job market could become more competitive and challenging for many individuals.

Automation tends to displace jobs that can be easily codified and mechanized, leading to increased competition in the job market and potential unemployment for those whose skills become less relevant. While some new opportunities might arise in emerging fields, the overall trend suggests that the challenge for ordinary workers would be substantial.
