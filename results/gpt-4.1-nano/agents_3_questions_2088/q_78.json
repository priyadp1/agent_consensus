        "raw_output": "I believe that people leaving our country for jobs in other countries can be a significant concern. When skilled or young workers migrate abroad, it can lead to a shortage of talent and hamper economic growth. While some migration might be inevitable due to global job opportunities, if a large number of people are leaving consistently, this could weaken domestic industries and social structures. Therefore, I consider it a moderately big problem, as it impacts both the economy and social stability, but it might not be as urgent as other issues like healthcare or safety. \n\nANSWER: B",

While it can indicate economic issues or lack of opportunities locally, it doesn\u2019t necessarily threaten the country's stability or safety directly. It\u2019s significant enough to be a concern, but not typically considered an immediate or severe issue compared to national security or widespread economic collapse.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it can impact the economy and workforce availability, it might not be as critical as other issues like corruption or healthcare. However, a significant emigration of talent and labor can weaken the country\u2019s growth and stability over time. Therefore, it warrants concern but not the highest level of urgency. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe that people leaving our country for jobs in other countries can be a significant concern. When a considerable number of talented and working-age individuals migrate abroad, it can lead to labor shortages, hinder economic growth, and cause demographic imbalances. While some level of emigration might be inevitable or even beneficial in terms of remittances and cultural exchange, a persistent and substantial outflow can weaken domestic industries and social systems. Therefore, I consider it a moderately big problem. \n\nANSWER: B",
