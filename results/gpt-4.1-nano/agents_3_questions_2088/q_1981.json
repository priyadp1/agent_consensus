        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "I would choose option D because Hamid Karzai faced numerous challenges during his presidency, including issues with corruption, governance, and establishing strong international relations. His leadership was often viewed with skepticism regarding effective decision-making on global issues, which diminishes confidence in his ability to do the right thing on world affairs.\n\nANSWER: D",

      "1": {
        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I would choose C because Hamid Karzai's leadership during his presidency was often characterized by internal political challenges and a reliance on international support, which may have affected perceptions of his ability to independently handle complex global issues. While he did work towards stabilizing Afghanistan and maintaining international relations, doubts may remain about his capacity to consistently do the right thing on world affairs without external influence or internal constraints.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "My confidence in Hamid Karzai's ability to do the right thing regarding world affairs is limited due to his tenure as President of Afghanistan, during which his leadership was often criticized for corruption and inability to stabilize the country. Many viewed his leadership as chaotic and ineffective, which impacts trust in his international decision-making. Therefore, I would select the option indicating low confidence.\n\nANSWER: C",

While he made efforts toward stabilization and international cooperation, skepticism remains about his capacity to consistently do the right thing on the world stage without external influences or internal constraints.\n\nANSWER: C",

While he may have had some moments of decision-making, the overall concern about his leadership's effectiveness suggests that my confidence would be not too much at best, but likely leaning towards not too much confidence overall. Therefore, I choose:\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "Considering Hamid Karzai's presidency was marred by significant challenges such as corruption issues, governance concerns, and reliance on international assistance, I feel less confident in his ability to handle global affairs effectively and independently. While he did make efforts toward stability, the skepticism surrounding his leadership diminishes my confidence in his capacity to always do the right thing on world affairs.\n\nANSWER: D",

Although he attempted to stabilize Afghanistan, the widespread doubts about his effectiveness and integrity suggest that my confidence would be quite limited. Therefore, I choose:\n\nANSWER: D",

His tenure was marked by challenges that likely diminish trust in his judgment regarding world affairs. Therefore, I believe my confidence would be somewhat limited, aligning with skepticism expressed in previous responses.\n\nANSWER: C",
