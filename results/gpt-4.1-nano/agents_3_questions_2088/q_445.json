        "raw_output": "My assessment of the quality of life for Muslim women in my country compared to most Muslim countries depends on several factors, including social, legal, and economic conditions. If my country has progressive laws, better access to education and healthcare, and greater social acceptance, then the quality of life may be better. Conversely, if there are more restrictions, inequalities, or socio-political issues, it could be worse. If the conditions are similar across most Muslim countries and my country aligns with that average, then it would be about the same. Considering current global and regional trends, I believe that my country's environment offers a relatively more supportive context for Muslim women, making their quality of life somewhat better than in many other Muslim countries.\n\nANSWER: A",
