  "question": "People have different views of democracy. As I read you a list, please tell me how important each of the following is in a democracy to you. People have access to the internet without government censorship or interference...do you think this is very important, somewhat important, not too important or not important at all in a democracy?",
  "options": [
    "Very important",
    "Somewhat important",
    "Not too important",
    "Not important at all"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Access to the internet without government censorship is crucial for a healthy democracy because it ensures that citizens can freely access diverse information, express their opinions, and participate in informed debates. When governments interfere or censor online content, it limits transparency, suppresses dissent, and undermines citizens' rights to free speech. Therefore, having an unfettered internet aligns with democratic values of openness and accountability, making it very important in a democracy.\n\nANSWER: A"
