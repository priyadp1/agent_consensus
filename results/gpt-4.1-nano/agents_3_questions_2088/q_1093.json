        "raw_output": "Increased trade with China could bring both benefits and challenges for the United States. On one hand, it could lead to cheaper goods, more competition that spurs innovation, and stronger economic ties. On the other hand, it might also contribute to job displacement in certain industries, concerns over trade imbalances, and strategic considerations about reliance on a major global partner. Given these factors, many would see it as a mixed situation but lean towards cautious optimism about the potential benefits, especially if trade is managed carefully to mitigate downsides.\n\nANSWER: B",

On one hand, it may lead to more economic growth, lower prices for consumers, and stronger diplomatic relations. On the other hand, it could also result in job losses in certain industries, concerns over intellectual property rights, and increased dependency.
