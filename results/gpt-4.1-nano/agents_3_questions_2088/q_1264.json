        "raw_output": "I believe that while military strength can be a deterrent and important component of national security, relying solely on it does not guarantee peace. True peace often requires diplomacy, economic stability, and international cooperation. Excessive focus on military solutions may lead to escalation and conflict rather than resolution. Therefore, I mostly disagree with the statement that the best way to ensure peace is through military strength, as a balanced approach tends to be more effective in maintaining lasting peace.\n\nANSWER: C",

Diplomacy, cooperation, and understanding are also essential components for achieving enduring peace.

Sustainable peace is often achieved through a combination of diplomatic efforts, economic stability, international cooperation, and conflict resolution. Relying solely on military might can sometimes escalate tensions or lead to conflicts rather than prevent them. Therefore, I mostly disagree with the idea that military strength alone guarantees peace, though I acknowledge its role as part of a broader strategy.\n\nANSWER: C",

However, relying solely on military power overlooks the importance of diplomacy, economic cooperation, and addressing the underlying causes of conflict. A comprehensive approach that includes military strength alongside diplomatic efforts is more effective in promoting lasting peace.
