        "raw_output": "Given the complex and ongoing nature of the Syrian conflict, which has persisted for over a decade with many geopolitical and internal factors at play, it seems unlikely that the war will conclude within the next year. While some progress toward peace might be made, resolving such deeply rooted issues is typically a lengthy process. Although hopes for a faster resolution exist, experience suggests that the conflict is more likely to continue for several more years before a definitive end is in sight. Therefore, the most reasonable prediction is that the war will continue for more than five years.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Predicting the end of the Syrian conflict is complex due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, regional involvement, and internal political dynamics. Given the history of prolonged conflicts and the difficulty in reaching comprehensive peace agreements, it seems unlikely that the war will conclude within the next year or even five years. It is more plausible that the conflict may persist beyond five years without significant resolution. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "The conflict in Syria has shown considerable resilience over the years, involving complex political, regional, and international factors. Despite some efforts toward peace and negotiations, the situation remains unstable, with ongoing violence and divisions. Given this complexity, it seems unlikely that the war will be fully resolved within the next year, though some progress could be made. While a resolution may be possible within five years, the enduring nature of the conflict and the numerous challenges suggest it could continue beyond that timeframe. Therefore, the most reasonable expectation is that the war will persist for more than five years.\n\nANSWER: C",
