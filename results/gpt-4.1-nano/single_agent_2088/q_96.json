  "question": "Now I'm going to read you a list of countries.  For each one, please tell me whether you would favor or oppose admitting it into the European Union in the next ten years...Croatia",
  "options": [
    "Favor",
    "Oppose"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Croatia has already been a member of the European Union since 2013, so the question about admitting it again does not apply in the typical sense. If considering further integration or support for Croatia's continued membership and development within the EU framework, favoring its ongoing accession or integration is reasonable, especially given its successful accession and commitment to EU standards. Therefore, I would favor its continued EU membership and support further integration efforts.\n\nANSWER: A"
