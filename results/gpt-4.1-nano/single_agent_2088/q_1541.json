  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe China is more important to Australia because of the significant economic relationship, including trade and investment, which has grown substantially over recent years. While the United States remains a key security partner and ally, China's influence on Australia's economy makes it more vital overall. The interconnectedness and dependence on China for exports like minerals and agricultural products highlight its critical role in Australia's prosperity. Therefore, understanding economic dependencies and global shifts suggests China holds greater importance for Australia's future development.\n\nANSWER: B",
