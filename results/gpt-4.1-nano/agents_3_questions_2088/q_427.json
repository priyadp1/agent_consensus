        "raw_output": "My view on this depends on various factors such as the nature of the U.S. response, its consistency with democratic principles, and its impact on stability and human rights in Egypt. If the U.S. actions have helped promote reforms, stability, or protect human rights, then they could be seen as having a positive effect. Conversely, if their involvement has led to increased repression, instability, or hindered progress toward democratic governance, the impact would be negative. Given the complexity and mixed outcomes observed over the years, I believe the response has likely had a mixed impact, but overall leaning towards negative due to the challenges faced. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "In my opinion, the U.S. response to the political situation in Egypt has had a predominantly negative impact. Historically, U.S. involvement in Egypt's political affairs has sometimes undermined local sovereignty and led to increased instability or resentment among the Egyptian population. Efforts seen as interfering or inconsistent may have contributed to polarization and hindered genuine national progress. Therefore, I believe the overall effect has been more detrimental than beneficial.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "The U.S. response to Egypt's political situation has been a complex and somewhat mixed outcome. In some instances, U.S. aid and diplomatic efforts have supported stability and economic development, which could be seen as positive. However, criticisms exist regarding insufficient support for democratic reforms and for prioritizing strategic interests over human rights, potentially prolonging unrest or suppressing political freedoms. Overall, these mixed factors lead me to believe that the impact has been neither wholly positive nor wholly negative.\n\nANSWER: C",

While there may have been some efforts to support stability, history shows that foreign interference often undermines local sovereignty and can exacerbate unrest or resentment among the population. The overall effect appears to hinder genuine progress rather than promote it, especially considering issues like political instability and lack of democratic support.
