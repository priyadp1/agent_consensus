    "People should be able to say these things publically",
    "Government should be able to prevent people from saying these things",

  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that freedom of speech is important in a free society, even when statements are offensive to people's religion or beliefs. Allowing individuals to express themselves publicly fosters open dialogue and diverse perspectives. However, there should be limits if such speech incites violence or hatred, but broadly restricting offensive statements could undermine fundamental rights. Therefore, I think people should generally be able to say these things publicly.  \nANSWER: A",
