Increasing involvement could escalate tensions and potentially lead to unforeseen conflicts, while decreasing might undermine regional stability and Russia's strategic interests.

Increasing involvement could escalate tensions or prolong conflicts, while decreasing it might allow for the resurgence of instability.
