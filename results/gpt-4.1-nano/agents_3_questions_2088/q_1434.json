        "raw_output": "I believe it will get worse because ongoing industrial activities, urbanization, and the effects of climate change tend to increase air pollution levels. Although efforts are being made to combat pollution, it often lags behind the rapid growth in emissions and pollution sources. Without significant policy changes or technological advancements, the trend might continue to worsen over the next five years.\n\nANSWER: B",
