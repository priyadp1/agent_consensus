  "question": "Do you think people should be able to say these types of things publically OR the government should be able to prevent people from saying these things in some circumstances. e. statements that are sexually explicit",

    "People should be able to say these things publically",
    "Government should be able to prevent people from saying these things",

  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "People should be able to say these things publicly because freedom of expression is a fundamental right that allows individuals to share ideas and opinions without undue censorship. Limiting such speech could hinder open discourse and personal liberty, even if the content is sexually explicit. While there are circumstances where restrictions are necessary, a broad ability to express oneself is important for a free society. Therefore, I believe people should have the freedom to say these things publicly.\n\nANSWER: A",
