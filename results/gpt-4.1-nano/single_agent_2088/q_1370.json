  "raw_output": "Being an active member of a political organization can be quite effective because it allows individuals to directly engage with politics, influence decision-making, and mobilize others around shared goals. Active participation can lead to greater awareness, networking with like-minded people, and sometimes even impacting policy discussions or elections. While it may not always lead to immediate change, it definitely plays a significant role in shaping government actions over time. Therefore, I believe it is quite effective in influencing what the government does.\n\nANSWER: A",
