        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "I would choose the \"Not at all likely\" option because I believe that individual action, such as contacting officials or protesting, depends on personal motivation and perceived effectiveness. While discrimination is a serious issue, I may feel that my personal impact might be limited or that other avenues are more effective for addressing such concerns. Additionally, concerns about time, safety, or political efficacy might influence my decision not to participate actively. \n\nANSWER: D",

While I consider the issue important and believe activism can create change, I am not highly inclined to take action independently.
