  "options": [
    "Morally acceptable",
    "Morally unacceptable",
    "Not a moral issue",
    "Depends on the situation (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that using contraceptives is a morally acceptable choice because it allows individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and family planning, which can promote responsible parenting and health. Many argue that it is a personal matter concerning individual rights rather than a moral issue, as long as it involves consenting adults. Therefore, I see it as primarily a matter of personal morality or ethics rather than a universally moral or immoral act.\n\nANSWER: A"
