For each one, would it be a very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad or very bad way of governing this country? a. a democratic system where citizens, not elected officials, vote directly on major national issues to decide what becomes law",

        "raw_output": "A direct democracy where citizens vote on all major issues can be empowering and ensure that the government truly reflects the people's will. However, it also poses practical challenges, such as the risk of uninformed decision-making, slow response times for urgent matters, and the potential for majority tyranny over minority rights. While it might work well in small communities, implementing such a system at the national level might not be very practical or effective for a large and diverse country. Overall, I see it as somewhat good but with significant limitations.\n\nANSWER: B",

However, it may be impractical for complex or highly technical issues and could lead to populism or hasty decisions without expert input.

        "raw_output": "A system where citizens vote directly on major issues can be empowering because it allows for greater public participation and ensures that citizens have a direct say in important decisions. However, it can also pose challenges such as the potential for uninformed voting, the influence of populism, and difficulties in managing complex policy issues through direct votes alone. While it promotes democratic involvement, it might not always lead to well-informed or sustainable decisions. Considering these factors, I believe it could be very good in some contexts but might also have significant drawbacks, making it a mixed approach overall.\n\nANSWER: B",
