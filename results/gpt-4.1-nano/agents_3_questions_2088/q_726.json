Japan is a longstanding ally with strong economic ties and shared values, and while it's unlikely to be considered a \"great deal\" of trust due to the complexities of international relations, the partnership and mutual interests suggest a significant degree of trust. Therefore, I would choose B.\n\nANSWER: B",
