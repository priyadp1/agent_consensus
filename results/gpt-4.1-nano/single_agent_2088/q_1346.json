  "question": "I'd like your opinion about the effectiveness of different ways of trying to influence what the government does. How effective is it to...phone a live radio or TV show to express an opinion...very effective, somewhat effective, not too effective, or not at all effective?",
  "options": [
    "Very effective",
    "Somewhat effective",
    "Not too effective",
    "Not at all effective"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Phone-in opinions on live radio or TV shows can have some influence by raising awareness and showing public sentiment, but they often have limited direct effect on policy change or government action. While they can be a useful way to voice concerns publicly, their overall impact is typically moderate because policymakers may prioritize more formal channels or data-driven advocacy. Therefore, I believe this method is somewhat effective in influencing government decisions.\n\nANSWER: B",
