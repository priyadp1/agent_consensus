        "raw_output": "The changes since 1991, including social, economic, and cultural shifts, have had a mixed impact on family values. On one hand, increased individualism and globalization may have challenged traditional family structures and values, potentially weakening them. On the other hand, some positive developments such as greater gender equality and awareness of family health and well-being might have strengthened certain aspects of family life. Overall, the influence seems more negative than positive, as traditional values have faced significant erosion in many places. Therefore, I believe the changes have had a bad influence on family values.\n\nANSWER: C",

Some positive developments like increased individual freedoms and improved living standards have strengthened family bonds in certain contexts. However, these changes have also introduced challenges such as rising divorce rates, shifting gender roles, and changing cultural norms, which in some cases have weakened traditional family structures. Overall, I believe the influence has been mixed but leans toward being detrimental to traditional family values, as they seem to have become more flexible and less anchored in age-old norms. Therefore, I consider the overall influence to be somewhat negative. \n\nANSWER: C",
