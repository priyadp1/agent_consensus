    "Yes--US policies",
    "No--not US policies"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe I am more pessimistic these days about the Middle East becoming more democratic because recent U.S. policies, such as support for certain governments and military interventions, may have contributed to stability concerns and skepticism about democratic progress in the region.
