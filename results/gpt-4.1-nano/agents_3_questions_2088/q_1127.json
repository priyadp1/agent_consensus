While opinions on policy solutions may vary and be subjective, the foundational facts around issues like climate change, economic data, or historical events are usually accepted by most people, even if they interpret or prioritize those facts differently. Disagreement on basic facts can undermine meaningful debate, so the tendency is for most to agree on them, even if debates around policies continue.\n\nANSWER: A",

While opinions on policies can vary widely, the agreement on fundamental facts such as climate change, the existence of historical events, or the basic principles of science generally remains stable across different groups. Disagreements on these facts are often influenced by misinformation or personal beliefs, but overall, there is a significant consensus on many basic facts that underpin public understanding and policy debates.\n\nANSWER: A",
