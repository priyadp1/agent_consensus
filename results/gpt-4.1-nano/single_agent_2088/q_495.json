  "options": [
    "Very big problem",
    "Moderately big problem",
    "Small problem",
    "Not a problem at all",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Corrupt political leaders are often viewed as a significant issue because they can undermine trust in government, distort justice, and hurt economic growth. While some may see this as a serious problem affecting many aspects of society, others might consider it a serious issue but not necessarily the biggest concern compared to other problems like economic instability or security. I believe that corruption at leadership levels greatly impacts the functioning of the country, and addressing it is crucial for positive change.\n\nANSWER: A"
