        "raw_output": "I believe the primary reason the U.S. might use military force against Iraq is because it perceives Saddam Hussein as a threat to stability in the Middle East and to global peace. Historically, concerns about Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction, regional destabilization, and the potential for the regime to threaten neighboring countries have been cited as justification for military intervention. While some argue that it could also be part of a broader pattern of the U.S. targeting Muslim countries seen as unfriendly, the official rationale has predominantly centered on threats to stability and security. This makes option (A) the more compelling explanation in this context.\n\nANSWER: A",

The concern was that Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction and its history of aggression could destabilize the Middle East and threaten global security. While some critics have argued that the U.S. had broader motives related to conflicts with Muslim countries, official reasons centered on security threats and the need to prevent further destabilization. Therefore, the primary justification appears to be the threat to stability.\n\nANSWER: A",
