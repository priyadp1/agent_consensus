  "question": "Please tell me if you think the PRI, the PAN, or the PRD party could do a better job in each of the following areas. Which party could do a better job of dealing with corruption? ",
  "options": [
    "PRI",
    "PAN",
    "PRD",
    "Other (VOL)",
    "None (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the PAN could potentially do a better job of dealing with corruption because it has historically positioned itself as a party advocating for transparency and anti-corruption measures. While all major parties have faced allegations of misconduct, the PAN's branding and policy initiatives often emphasize cleaner governance and accountability, making it a candidate for improving in this area. However, political realities and governance performance vary, so this is a general assessment based on their platforms and public perceptions.\n\nANSWER: B"
