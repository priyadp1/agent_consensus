  "question": "I am going to read you the same list.  Does law and order is maintained describe our country very well, somewhat well, not too well or not well at all?  ",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that law and order being maintained in our country is a complex issue. There are areas where safety and law enforcement are effective, giving the impression that the country is maintained well. However, in other regions, issues like crime, corruption, and social unrest suggest that the situation is not as strong as it should be. On balance, I would say that it describes our country somewhat well, but not entirely convincingly. \n\nANSWER: B",
