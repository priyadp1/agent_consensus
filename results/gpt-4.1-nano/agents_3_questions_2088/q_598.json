        "answer": "E",
        "raw_output": "I do not have personal opinions or preferences, but based on general knowledge, the Left Party (PG) is often viewed positively by individuals who support progressive social policies and believe in strong welfare programs. Conversely, those with conservative or opposing views may see it unfavorably.

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I don't have personal opinions, but I can analyze general perceptions. The Left Party (PG) is often viewed through different lenses depending on political context, possibly viewed favorably by supporters who align with their policies or less favorably by opponents. Without specific information about current public sentiment, it's challenging to assign a definite judgment. Considering this, I would say that respondents might have varied opinions, and in many surveys, some may hold a somewhat favorable view while others may be unfavorable. As I need to choose one, and given the tendency of surveys to reflect cautious views unless specifically positive, I will select somewhat unfavorable, assuming a neutral-to-critical public stance.\n\nANSWER: C",

Since the survey options do not include a neutral choice, and my assessment aligns more with respondents who might lean toward a somewhat unfavorable view in the absence of detailed support, I will select the same cautious stance.\n\nANSWER: C",

Since I do not have personal opinions and cannot ascertain specific perceptions, the safest choice to reflect uncertainty or lack of information is \"DK/Refused.\" However, if I were to provide an opinion based on typical public attitudes, a somewhat unfavorable view would be plausible. \n\nANSWER: C",
