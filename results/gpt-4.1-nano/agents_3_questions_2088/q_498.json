        "raw_output": "Germany's efforts at acknowledging and apologizing for its actions during World War II have been a complex and ongoing process. While many consider Germany's official apologies, memorials, and education about the Holocaust to be significant steps toward reconciliation and acknowledgment, some believe that these measures are still insufficient given the gravity of the atrocities committed. Others might contend that Germany has already made extensive apologies and that focusing on continued acknowledgment may be unnecessary. Ultimately, perspectives vary depending on historical interpretations and individual opinions about what constitutes adequate apology and reconciliation.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The issue of whether Germany has apologized sufficiently for its actions during World War II depends on perceptions of accountability and acknowledgment of past atrocities. While Germany has issued official apologies and taken steps towards reconciliation, some believe these gestures are not enough given the scale of suffering caused, and that a more comprehensive acknowledgment is still denied or insufficient. Others might argue that the existing apologies are enough or that pursuing further apologies could reopen old wounds, thus no further apology is necessary. Considering these perspectives, I believe that Germany has not yet apologized sufficiently, given that ongoing recognition and reparative measures still seem to fall short of full acknowledgment and reconciliation.\n\nANSWER: B",
