    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Reducing the trade deficit is an important economic goal that can help improve national economic stability, protect domestic industries, and promote fair trade relationships. While it is significant, prioritizing it as a top priority might divert attention from other critical issues such as national security, diplomatic relations, or domestic economic growth. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider it as a matter of some priority, but not necessarily the foremost concern.\n\nANSWER: B",
