        "raw_output": "Global poverty is a significant issue that can impact economic stability, migration patterns, and global development. While it may not directly threaten national security in all cases, the interconnectedness of the world means that extreme poverty elsewhere can lead to regional instability and humanitarian crises that eventually affect other countries. Therefore, it is important to recognize global poverty as a concern that requires international attention and cooperation, but it may not be perceived as an immediate or major threat by everyone.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it may not pose an immediate direct threat like military conflicts or terrorism, its widespread effects can lead to increased instability, migration issues, and economic disruptions that could eventually affect our nation.

While it may not directly threaten the security of my country in the immediate sense, the interconnected nature of today's globalized world means that extreme poverty and its effects can lead to social unrest, migration pressures, and health crises that might indirectly affect my country. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider global poverty a minor threat, acknowledging its broader implications without overestimating its direct impact on national security.\n\nANSWER: B",
