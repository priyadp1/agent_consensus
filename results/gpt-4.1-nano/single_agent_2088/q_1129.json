  "question": "Some countries have decided to ban the wearing of head scarves by Muslim women in public places including schools. Do you think this is a good idea or a bad idea?",
  "options": [
    "Good idea",
    "Bad idea"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe banning head scarves in public places, including schools, is a bad idea because it restricts religious freedom and personal choice. Wearing a head scarf can be an important aspect of cultural and religious identity for many Muslim women, and prohibiting it may infringe on their rights to express their beliefs. Instead of bans, fostering understanding and respecting diversity would promote social harmony and individual freedoms.\n\nANSWER: B",
