  "question": "According to news reports, the American government has been monitoring communications, such as emails and phone calls, in the U.S. and many other countries. In your opinion, is it acceptable or unacceptable for the American government to monitor communications from...American citizens?",
  "options": [
    "Acceptable",
    "Unacceptable"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that monitoring communications of American citizens is unacceptable because it raises serious privacy concerns and can infringe on individual rights. While security is important, there should be clear limits and oversight to prevent abuse and protect civil liberties. Unauthorized or unchecked surveillance can lead to a loss of trust in government and diminish personal freedoms. Therefore, I think such monitoring should be restricted and only used under strict, transparent circumstances.\n\nANSWER: B"
