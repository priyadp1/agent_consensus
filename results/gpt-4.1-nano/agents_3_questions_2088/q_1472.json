Given the serious threats posed by terrorism, a firm stance with adequate support for law enforcement and military actions is necessary to ensure national security. However, it's also important that this support is balanced with civil liberties and diplomatic efforts, which seems to be the case to a reasonable extent. Overly aggressive policy could erode public trust and international relationships, while insufficient support could leave the nation vulnerable. Therefore, I think the government has maintained a reasonable approach, neither overly supportive nor insufficient.\n\nANSWER: C",
