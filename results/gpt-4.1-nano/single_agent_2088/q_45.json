  "question": "Now thinking about standards for products and services...In general, do you trust European standards or American standards more when it comes to data privacy?",
  "options": [
    "European standards",
    "American standards",
    "Neither (VOL)",
    "Both (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I tend to trust European standards more when it comes to data privacy because the European Union has implemented comprehensive regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which sets strict rules for data protection and privacy. These standards often prioritize individual rights and have globally influenced privacy policies, making them seem more robust. In contrast, American standards are typically more business-friendly and may not provide the same level of consumer privacy protections, which makes me trust European standards more in this context.\n\nANSWER: A"
