        "raw_output": "Turkey has been a candidate country for many years and has a strategic importance for the European Union both geographically and economically. However, there are concerns from some member states regarding Turkey\u2019s adherence to EU standards on democracy, human rights, and rule of law, which have hindered progress toward accession. Balancing these considerations, I see potential benefits in fostering closer ties but also acknowledge significant challenges. Given the current geopolitical situation and progress of reforms, I would lean towards opposition, respecting the complex realities and ongoing concerns surrounding Turkey\u2019s accession.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Turkey's accession to the European Union has been a complex and contentious issue due to political, cultural, and economic considerations. While Turkey is geographically partly in Europe and has a large and growing economy, there are concerns about human rights, democracy, and the rule of law that have hindered progress. Supporting Turkey's EU membership could promote stability and reforms, but opposition stems from unresolved political issues and differing cultural perspectives. Given these factors, I am inclined to oppose its accession in the next ten years.\nANSWER: B",

While Turkey is a significant regional player and has long-standing ties with Europe, there are concerns related to its human rights record, democratic institutions, and adherence to EU membership criteria. Additionally, political and cultural differences have contributed to skepticism among some member states. Given these factors, I believe that supporting a cautious approach that prioritizes reforms and alignment with EU standards is crucial, and therefore I would oppose Turkey's immediate admission within the next ten years.\n\nANSWER: B",
