  "question": "Who benefits most from American ideas and customs spreading around the world -- the American people, OR people in other parts of the world?",
  "options": [
    "The American people",
    "People in other parts of the world",
    "Both/neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The spread of American ideas and customs can be seen as mutually beneficial. People in other parts of the world often gain access to innovative technologies, cultural products, and ideas that can improve quality of life, promote diversity, and foster understanding. At the same time, the American people and economy benefit from the global influence, which can enhance soft power, promote exports, and support cultural industries. However, the primary beneficiaries in terms of direct advantages tend to be the people in other parts of the world who gain new opportunities and cultural richness, while Americans often serve as the originators of these ideas. Therefore, I believe that people in other parts of the world benefit most from this cultural diffusion.\n\nANSWER: B",
