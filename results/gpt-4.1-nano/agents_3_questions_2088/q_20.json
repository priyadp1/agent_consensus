        "raw_output": "I believe that pollution and other environmental problems pose the greatest threat to the world. Environmental issues like climate change, pollution of air, water, and soil not only harm ecosystems but also directly impact human health and safety. If these problems are not addressed, they can lead to catastrophic consequences, including extreme weather events, resource shortages, and increased health crises. While infectious diseases and economic disparities are significant concerns, environmental degradation underpins many global challenges and has the potential to threaten the stability of societies on a large scale.\n\nANSWER: B",

Environmental degradation can exacerbate other issues, such as the spread of diseases and economic inequality, creating a cycle that's difficult to break. Addressing pollution not only preserves natural resources but also reduces the risk of catastrophic climate-related disasters, making it an urgent global concern.\n\nANSWER: B",

Environmental issues can lead to natural disasters, loss of biodiversity, and long-term health problems for societies worldwide, making them a fundamental threat to global stability. Addressing pollution can also help mitigate other problems like infectious diseases, which often spread due to environmental degradation, and social inequality, as marginalized communities tend to suffer more from environmental hazards.\n\nANSWER: B",
