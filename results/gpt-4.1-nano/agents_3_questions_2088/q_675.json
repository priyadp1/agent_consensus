While diplomatic initiatives have been undertaken, progress remains slow, and some may argue that political will and sustained commitment are lacking.

While efforts have been made, diplomatic initiatives often face significant obstacles, and ongoing tensions suggest that more aggressive or sustained engagement might be necessary to achieve a lasting resolution.
