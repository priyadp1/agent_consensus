        "raw_output": "The decision between prioritizing alliances and compromising for the sake of international cooperation versus pursuing national interests independently reflects different foreign policy philosophies. If I believe that maintaining strong alliances and working with them, even at the cost of some compromise, is essential for stability and security, I would lean toward the first statement. Conversely, if I think that a country's primary obligation is to its own interests and that these should take precedence even if it causes disagreements with allies, I would choose the second statement. Personal views on sovereignty, diplomacy, and international cooperation influence this choice. Therefore, I select the option that aligns with prioritizing national interests over alliance considerations.\n\nANSWER: B",

While taking allies' interests into account is valuable in fostering cooperation, making unilateral choices aligned with the country's own priorities tends to be more consistent with protecting national security and values, particularly when allies' opinions diverge strongly.
