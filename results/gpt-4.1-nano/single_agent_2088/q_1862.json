  "question": "If the your country government used torture against people suspected of terrorism to try to gain information about possible attacks in our country, do you think this could be justified or could not be justified?",
  "options": [

    "Could not be justified",
    "Depends (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that using torture violates fundamental human rights and can lead to unreliable information, as individuals under extreme pain may say anything to end their suffering. While protecting national security is important, employing such methods could undermine the values and legal principles of the country, and may also fuel further violence or resentment. Therefore, I do not think torture can be justified, even in cases of suspected terrorism. \n\nANSWER: B",
