While family opinions can be valuable, ultimately, the woman knows best what suits her personality, values, and life goals. Allowing her to make her own decision empowers her and promotes independence, which are essential for a healthy partnership. However, involving family members can also provide support and guidance if done respectfully. Therefore, a balanced approach where the woman\u2019s preference is prioritized, but family input is also considered, would be ideal.\n\nANSWER: A",
