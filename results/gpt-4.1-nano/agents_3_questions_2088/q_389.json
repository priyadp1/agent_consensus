Stability in neighboring countries is important for regional peace, but current circumstances suggest it is not an immediate or major threat. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe political instability in Pakistan could pose a concern for my country, especially if it leads to regional instability or affects international relations. Such instability might contribute to increased security risks, economic disruptions, or refugee flows, which could impact neighboring countries or the broader region. However, whether it constitutes a major threat depends on the current stability and international engagement with Pakistan. Overall, I would consider it a minor threat given the potential for localized issues but not immediate widespread danger.\n\nANSWER: B",

Instability in neighboring or regional countries can sometimes lead to economic disruptions, migration issues, or security concerns, especially if conflicts escalate or spill over borders.

While it may not cause immediate or widespread issues, the regional instability and potential for spill-over effects such as security concerns or economic impacts suggest it is something to monitor.
