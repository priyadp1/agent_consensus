  "question": "Going forward, who do you think will have more political power in our country - Vladimir Putin or Dmitry Medvedev?",
  "options": [
    "Vladimir Putin",
    "Dmitri Medvedev",
    "Both equally",
    "Neither"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe Vladimir Putin will continue to hold more political power because he has been the central figure in Russian politics for many years and maintains strong control over the government and security agencies. Dmitry Medvedev, while influential, has traditionally been viewed as a close associate or subordinate to Putin rather than an independent power center. Therefore, Putin's enduring dominance suggests he will have more influence going forward.\n\nANSWER: A"
