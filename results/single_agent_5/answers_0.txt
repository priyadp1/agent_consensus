When it comes to Germany’s decision-making in the European Union, do you think Germany has too much influence, has too little influence or has about the right amount of influence?

I believe Germany has about the right amount of influence in the European Union. While Germany is an economic powerhouse and naturally exerts significant influence, the EU's decision-making process is designed to balance member states' interests. This balance helps ensure that no single country dominates unduly, promoting cooperation and diversity of perspectives. Therefore, Germany's influence appears appropriate, neither overpowering nor negligible.
