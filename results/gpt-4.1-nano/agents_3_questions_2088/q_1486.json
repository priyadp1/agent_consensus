        "answer": "D",
        "raw_output": "I would choose D, no confidence at all, because Dmitry Medvedev's leadership in Russia has historically been associated with strategic actions that often prioritize national interests over global stability. Russia's recent foreign policy decisions and assertive stance in international affairs suggest a lack of trust in Medvedev's ability to do the right thing regarding world affairs.\n\nANSWER: D",
