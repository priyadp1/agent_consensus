    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "My opinion depends on various factors such as economic benefits, employment opportunities, and environmental impacts. While some foreign companies in the oil and petrol industry contribute positively through investments and job creation, concerns about environmental degradation, local resource exploitation, and profit repatriation also exist. Overall, I believe their presence has both positive and negative aspects, but given the extent of environmental and social challenges, I see their impact as more on the negative side, though not entirely detrimental. Therefore, I would lean toward viewing their impact as somewhat negative.\nANSWER: C"
