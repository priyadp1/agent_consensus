However, I also recognize that in certain situations, such as during times of crisis or when swift decision-making is required, non-democratic forms might be considered more effective or preferable for stability and order. For me, the preference depends on the context, but I lean toward democracy as the most desirable overall.\n\nANSWER: B",
