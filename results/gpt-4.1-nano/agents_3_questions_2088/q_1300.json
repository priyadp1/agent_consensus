        "raw_output": "During Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's presidency, France faced significant economic challenges, including high unemployment and sluggish growth, and his responses received mixed reviews. While some appreciated efforts to stimulate the economy and maintain social programs, others criticized perceived lack of decisive reforms and the persistence of economic difficulties. Overall, his handling of the European economic crisis was seen by many as insufficiently effective, leading to perceptions of underperformance in tackling these issues. Therefore, considering the overall public sentiment and economic context, his job performance is generally viewed as somewhat bad. \n\nANSWER: C",

While he engaged in efforts to stimulate growth and address unemployment, many critics viewed his approach as insufficient or ineffective, leading to mixed opinions among the public and analysts. Overall, his management is generally regarded as somewhat disappointing, with some acknowledging efforts made but ultimately facing difficulties in significantly improving the economic situation for France and the Eurozone during his term.\n\nANSWER: C",

The recognition of efforts to stimulate growth and curb unemployment shows some positive action, but overall, the difficulties and criticisms suggest a performance that is better than very bad but not quite good. \n\nANSWER: C",

Despite efforts to stimulate growth and address unemployment, the overall perception was that his performance was limited, and the economic situation remained difficult.
