        "raw_output": "U.S. aid to Pakistan has historically been a combination of military assistance and economic development efforts. While military aid has often been prominent, especially during periods of strategic cooperation and regional security concerns, there has also been substantial financial support aimed at development projects, health, education, and economic stability. However, in recent years, military aid tends to be more emphasized relative to economic aid, reflecting the strategic interests of the U.S. government in the region. Therefore, I believe that U.S. aid to Pakistan leans more toward military assistance, although economic aid remains a significant component.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "U.S. aid to Pakistan has historically been a combination of military support and economic assistance. While military aid has often been a significant component, particularly during periods of strategic partnerships or regional security concerns, economic aid aimed at development, infrastructure, and poverty alleviation has also played an important role. Given the evolving nature of U.S.-Pakistan relations, the aid has not typically been predominantly one over the other, but rather a balance depending on the geopolitical context. Therefore, it is most accurate to say that the aid is roughly split between the two purposes.\n\nANSWER: C",

However, in recent years, military aid has often taken a more prominent position due to strategic interests related to regional security and counterterrorism efforts. While economic aid remains important, especially in fostering long-term stability and development, it generally represents a smaller portion compared to military support. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the aid is mostly military, with some economic assistance but not in equal measure.\n\nANSWER: A",
