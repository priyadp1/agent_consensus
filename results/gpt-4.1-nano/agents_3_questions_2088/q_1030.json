        "raw_output": "Golden Dawn is a far-right political organization known for its controversial and often extremist views. Public opinion on such groups tends to be sharply divided due to their association with nationalism, xenophobia, and sometimes violence. If I have a negative opinion of them, I might see them as dangerous or harmful to social harmony. Conversely, if I have a positive view, I might support their political stance or ideology. Without specific context, I would likely have a somewhat unfavorable opinion given their reputation and the general public sentiment towards extremist groups. Therefore, I choose the option indicating a somewhat unfavorable view.\n\nANSWER: C",
