  "question": "Do you think that using military force against countries that may seriously threaten our country, but have not attacked us, can often be justified, sometimes be justified, rarely be justified, or never be justified?",
  "options": [
    "Often be justified",
    "Sometimes be justified",
    "Rarely be justified",
    "Never be justified"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that military force should be a last resort and used only when there is a clear, imminent threat that justifies such action. Preemptive strikes can sometimes prevent larger conflicts or protect national security, but they also risk unnecessary escalation and loss of life. Therefore, I think that using military force against countries that may threaten us, but have not yet attacked, can sometimes be justified, especially when there is credible evidence of a serious and imminent threat. This cautious approach helps balance security concerns with the importance of international diplomacy and avoiding unnecessary conflict.\n\nANSWER: B"
