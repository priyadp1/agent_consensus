        "raw_output": "I believe that the Congress's effectiveness and trustworthiness can vary depending on the current political climate and recent actions. If the Congress is seen as unproductive or corrupt, it can be considered a big problem because it hampers governance and affects public confidence. On the other hand, if it is functioning well and addressing issues effectively, it might be viewed as less problematic. Overall, given common public frustrations with politics, I would lean towards viewing it as a significant concern. Therefore, I think it is a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: D",

This suggests it is reasonably considered a moderate to big problem by the public. Therefore, I would classify it as a somewhat bad or very bad situation, but not necessarily the worst. The best fit choice reflecting a significant concern is D.\n\nANSWER: D",

Public frustrations with political inefficiency and corruption support this perspective. Therefore, I would classify it as a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: D",
