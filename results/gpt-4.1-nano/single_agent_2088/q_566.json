  "question": "What's the best model economy for your country to try to follow - a free market capitalist one such as in the United States or a state capitalist one such as in China?",
  "options": [
    "Free market capitalism",
    "State capitalism",
    "Neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe a balanced approach that incorporates the strengths of both models could be most beneficial. A free market system encourages innovation and individual entrepreneurship, driving economic growth and personal freedoms. Meanwhile, strategic government intervention can help address inequalities, provide public goods, and stabilize the economy during downturns. Relying solely on one model may overlook important societal needs or economic vulnerabilities. Therefore, blending elements from both can create a resilient and equitable economy tailored to the specific context of the country.\n\nANSWER: C"
