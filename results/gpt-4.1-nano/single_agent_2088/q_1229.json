  "question": "The government is considering a ban on Muslim women wearing full veils that cover all of the face except the eyes in public places including schools, hospitals, and government offices. Do you approve or disapprove of such a ban?",
  "options": [
    "Approve",
    "Disapprove"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I disapprove of such a ban because it restricts individuals' freedom to express their religious and cultural identity. Wearing religious attire like full veils can be an important personal and spiritual choice, and banning them in public spaces may promote discrimination and undermine principles of religious freedom and human rights. Furthermore, security concerns should be addressed without infringing on individual rights, and policies should strive to balance security with respect for diversity and personal autonomy.\n\nANSWER: B",
