People are more regularly connecting through social media, messaging apps, and virtual meetings, making communication across borders much more frequent. Similarly, international travel has become more accessible and affordable for many, leading to a noticeable rise in travel between countries. Therefore, these changes contribute to a sense that both communication and travel between people of different countries are happening more than they did five years ago, with the increase being quite substantial.\n\nANSWER: A",
