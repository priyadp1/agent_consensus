  "question": "In your opinion, do higher income people have too much influence in our political system, not enough influence, or about the right amount?",
  "options": [
    "Too much",
    "Not enough",
    "Right amount"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that higher income people have too much influence in our political system. Their financial resources often allow them to sway elections, funding campaigns and lobbying efforts that shape policies in their favor. This can lead to a system that favors the wealthy over the needs of the average citizen, undermining fairness and equal representation. A more balanced influence across all income levels would promote a healthier democracy and ensure that a wider range of voices are heard and considered.\n\nANSWER: A",
