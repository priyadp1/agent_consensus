        "raw_output": "I believe that while the international community can play a significant role in addressing climate change, there are many challenges related to coordination, political will, and enforcement. Success depends on collective action, but past efforts have been inconsistent, making me somewhat confident rather than very confident. My cautious optimism stems from the recognition that progress is possible, but uncertainty remains significant. Therefore, I am somewhat confident that actions by the international community will reduce the effects of global climate change.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that while the international community has made some efforts to address climate change, there is still a significant amount of work needed to achieve meaningful results. Many policies and initiatives face challenges such as political will, economic factors, and unequal commitment among nations, which can limit their overall effectiveness. Therefore, I am somewhat confident that actions will help, but not enough to be highly assured of a substantial reduction in global effects anytime soon.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I am somewhat confident that actions taken by the international community will significantly reduce the effects of global climate change. While there is increased awareness and some positive steps being made globally, the scale of the challenge and differing commitments among nations suggest that progress may be uneven and not entirely sufficient in the short term. Therefore, I believe there is hope, but also significant uncertainty about the overall effectiveness.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there have been positive developments, the challenges related to political will, economic disparities, and varying commitments among countries make it unlikely that the actions will be sufficiently impactful in the near future.

Past efforts have shown some progress but remain inconsistent, leading me to feel somewhat confident that current actions could reduce the effects, but uncertainty about the overall effectiveness persists.
