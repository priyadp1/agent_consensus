  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that having strong economic ties with the United States is more important because the US is a major global economic power with influence over international markets, trade policies, and financial stability. Strengthening the US economy can benefit many industries and promote stability domestically, which in turn can positively impact global economic prospects. While China is an important partner, fostering robust economic relations with the US tends to be a priority for many countries aiming for stability and growth. \n\nANSWER: B"
