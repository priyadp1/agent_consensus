  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the PAN (B) might be better equipped to handle organized crime and drug traffickers due to its emphasis on security and law enforcement policies, as well as its historical focus on tackling crime issues. The PAN's approach tends to prioritize strict enforcement and support for institutions responsible for maintaining order, which could contribute to more effective strategies against organized crime. However, it's important to recognize that political effectiveness also depends on current leadership and specific policies rather than party affiliation alone.\n\nANSWER: B"
