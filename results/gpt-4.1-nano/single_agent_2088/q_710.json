  "question": "If robots and computers were able to do much of the work currently being done by humans, do you think each of the following is likely or not likely to happen in your country as a result? a. Inequality between rich and poor would be much worse tha",
  "options": [
    "Yes, likely",
    "No, not likely",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "If robots and computers take over many jobs currently performed by humans, there is a concern that wealth and income could become even more concentrated among the wealthy who own the technology, leading to increased inequality. While some might believe that society could implement measures to mitigate this effect, the general expectation is that without significant policy intervention, inequality would likely worsen because the benefits of automation tend to accrue to those with capital and technological resources. Therefore, I believe it is likely that inequality between rich and poor would be much worse than now in my country.\n\nANSWER: A"
