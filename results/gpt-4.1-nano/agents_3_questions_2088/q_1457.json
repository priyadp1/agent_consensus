While awareness and prevention efforts have increased, the number of new infections and the challenges related to treatment remain significant. The overall burden of the disease has not notably decreased or increased, suggesting that the issue persists at a steady level over the past few years. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe that HIV/AIDS is still a significant health issue in our country, but the level of concern may have shifted over the past five years due to increased awareness, prevention efforts, and treatment options. While some might argue the problem has lessened because of these interventions, others might feel it remains equally or more pressing because of persistent challenges like stigma and underserved populations. Overall, I think the problem has become more manageable but not necessarily smaller or entirely the same, leading me to choose that it remains about the same as it was five years ago.\n\nANSWER: C",
