Conversely, if I see them as complicit with authoritarian practices or problematic for Venezuela's sovereignty, I might disapprove.

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that President Maduro's approach to relations with Cuba is complex. On one hand, the longstanding alliance between the two countries has provided political and economic support for Maduro's government, which some view positively. On the other hand, excessive reliance on Cuba has been criticized for limiting Venezuela's independence and exacerbating economic issues. Given the mixed perceptions and political sensitivities, I lean toward disapproval, but with recognition of the strategic alliance. Therefore, my choice reflects a nuanced perspective leaning slightly toward disapproval.\n\nANSWER: B",

Additionally, close ties with Cuba have been associated with political and economic issues that may not benefit the broader Venezuelan population.
