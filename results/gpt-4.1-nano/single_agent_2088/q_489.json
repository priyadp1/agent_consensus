  "question": "In re-building Iraq, how good a job are the US and its allies doing in taking into account the needs and interests of the Iraqi people?  Is the coalition doing an excellent job, a good job, only a fair job or a poor job in taking into consideration the needs and interests of the Iraqi people?",
  "options": [
    "Excellent",
    "Good",
    "Only fair",
    "Poor"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The US and its allies have faced significant challenges in rebuilding Iraq, often prioritizing security and political stability over the diverse needs of the Iraqi people. While some efforts have been made to promote infrastructure, governance, and economic development, many Iraqis continue to experience instability, sectarian tensions, and lack of comprehensive development. These issues suggest that the coalition's approach has been somewhat inconsistent in fully addressing the interests and needs of the Iraqi population, resulting in a fair assessment rather than an excellent or poor one.\n\nANSWER: C"
