        "raw_output": "In my opinion, being truly one's nationality is more about cultural identity, language, and shared values rather than the place of birth. While I acknowledge that many consider birthplace as a defining factor, I believe that a person's sense of national belonging can develop through upbringing, cultural connection, and personal identification, regardless of where they were born. Therefore, I think it is not very important to have been born in your country to be considered truly your nationality.\n\nANSWER: C",
