  "question": "Do you approve or disapprove of the way...Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n...is dealing with the new Arizona immigration law?",
  "options": [
    "Approve",
    "Neither approve nor disapprove  (DO NOT READ)",
    "Disapprove"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe it is important for the Mexican government to respect the sovereignty of other nations and avoid interfering in their internal policies. Since the Arizona immigration law primarily impacts cross-border issues and domestic policies within the United States, I am unsure whether President Calder\u00f3n's response has been appropriate or sufficient. Therefore, I choose to neither approve nor disapprove.\n\nANSWER: B"
