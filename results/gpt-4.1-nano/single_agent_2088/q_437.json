  "question": "Who do you think is conducting these drone attacks, the Pakistani government, the United States government, or someone else?",
  "options": [
    "Pakistani government",
    "U.S. government",
    "Someone else",
    "Both Pakistan and U.S. (DO NOT READ)",
    "Both Pakistan and U.S. (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Given the complex geopolitical situation and credible reports suggesting involvement from multiple parties, it is possible that both the Pakistani and U.S. governments could be involved in some capacity. However, based on the available publicly known information, the most probable scenario is that U.S. drone attacks have been conducted predominantly by the United States government, sometimes possibly with Pakistani complicity or knowledge. Therefore, I believe the responsible party is primarily the U.S. government.\n\nANSWER: B"
