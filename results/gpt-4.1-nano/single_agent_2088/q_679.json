  "options": [
    "Too much",

    "About the right amount"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe the United States generally relies on military strength about the right amount to achieve its foreign policy goals. This approach allows for a credible deterrent and the capacity to intervene when necessary, while also making space for diplomacy and diplomatic solutions. Overreliance on military force could lead to unnecessary conflict or alienate other nations, whereas relying too little might undermine national security and strategic interests. Striking a balanced approach seems most appropriate given the complex geopolitical landscape. \n\nANSWER: C"
