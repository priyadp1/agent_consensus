However, the transition has also faced challenges such as political instability, economic difficulties, and social unrest, which have impacted the country's overall stability and development.

While these positive developments represent progress, the country continues to face economic instability, political fragility, and social unrest, which have affected daily life and national cohesion. Given the complex realities, it is difficult to categorize the overall situation simply as better or worse; both positive changes and significant challenges coexist. Therefore, I believe the best assessment is that the country is both better and worse off in different respects, and the overall impact depends on one's perspective and the specific issues considered.\n\nANSWER: C",
