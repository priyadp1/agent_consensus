    "Not a problem",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "China\u2019s relationship with Pakistan is often viewed as strategically important, especially given their shared border and cooperation on economic and military projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. While some may see their alliance as a regional concern, many would consider it more of a geopolitical issue rather than a very serious problem affecting the broader international stability. Therefore, I think it is somewhat serious but not a top-tier concern for most people.\n\nANSWER: B"
