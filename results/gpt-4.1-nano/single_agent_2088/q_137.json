  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The United Nations plays a significant role in coordinating international efforts to address climate change, hosting conferences like COP meetings and promoting global agreements such as the Paris Agreement. While some may view its impact as limited due to differing national interests and the complexity of enforcing agreements, the UN remains a central platform for dialogue and policy coordination among countries. Overall, it seems that the UN is making a somewhat good effort in tackling global climate change, though challenges remain. Therefore, I would rate its performance as somewhat good.\n\nANSWER: B"
