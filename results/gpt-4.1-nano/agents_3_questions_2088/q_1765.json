        "raw_output": "Supporting the effort to standardize American and European standards for products and services can facilitate trade, reduce costs for manufacturers, and make it easier for consumers to access high-quality goods across both markets. However, there are also concerns that harmonizing standards might undermine local regulations, safety standards, or unique national priorities. Balancing the benefits of easier trade with the need to maintain appropriate safeguards and consumer protections suggests that a moderate level of support is most appropriate. Therefore, I lean toward some support, recognizing the potential benefits while being cautious of possible drawbacks.\n\nANSWER: B",
