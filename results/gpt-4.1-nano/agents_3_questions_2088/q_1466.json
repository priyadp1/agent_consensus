        "raw_output": "Corporations have a complex influence on the country's development. Many believe that large corporations contribute positively by creating jobs, boosting economic growth, and fostering innovation. However, others feel that corporations sometimes prioritize profits over social well-being, leading to negative consequences such as inequality, environmental harm, or political influence. Overall, perceptions tend to be mixed, but many see the influence as more harmful than beneficial, especially when corporate interests override public needs. Based on these considerations, I think the influence of corporations is more likely to be viewed as somewhat bad by the general public.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Corporations can have a significant impact on a country's development and well-being. In many cases, they drive economic growth, create jobs, and foster innovation, which could be seen as a positive influence. However, they can also prioritize profits over social and environmental concerns, leading to inequalities, pollution, or influence over politics that may detract from the public good. Given these mixed effects, opinions might lean toward viewing corporations' influence as more harmful than beneficial, especially when their power seems to undermine democratic processes or widen the gap between rich and poor. Therefore, my perception is that corporations' influence is somewhat bad in my country.\n\nANSWER: C",
