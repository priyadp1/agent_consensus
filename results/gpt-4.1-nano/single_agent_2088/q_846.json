  "question": "How much interest do you think the United States is now taking in what goes on in Africa? Would you say it is taking a great deal of interest, a fair amount of interest, not too much interest, or is it taking no interest at all?",
  "options": [
    "Great deal",
    "Fair amount",
    "Not too much",
    "Not at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "In my view, the United States is currently taking a fair amount of interest in what goes on in Africa. While there are ongoing diplomatic, economic, and strategic engagements, it often does not seem to be a primary focus compared to other regions. The attention given appears proportional to their broader foreign policy priorities, but it doesn't seem to be a significant or overwhelming concern at this moment. Therefore, I believe the appropriate choice is a moderate level of interest. \n\nANSWER: B"
