  "question": "Why do you have an unfavorable view of the United States?  Is it mostly because of President George W. Bush or is it more a general problem with America?",
  "options": [
    "Mostly Bush",
    "America in general",
    "Both (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "My unfavorable view of the United States stems from multiple factors, but it is primarily due to broader policies and systemic issues that have shaped the country's reputation over time, rather than simply the actions of President George W. Bush. While his presidency certainly influenced some perceptions, many concerns are rooted in ongoing American foreign policy, social inequalities, and international conduct that are more persistent and widespread. Therefore, my view is more about America in general rather than being solely tied to one president.\n\nANSWER: B"
