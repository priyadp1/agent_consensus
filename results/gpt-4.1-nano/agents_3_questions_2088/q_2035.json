        "raw_output": "Experiencing Hurricane Maria profoundly impacted my perspective on materialism. Prior to the disaster, I placed significant value on possessions and consumer goods. The destruction and loss I witnessed made me realize that material things are fleeting and not the true source of happiness or security. As a result, my perceptions shifted, and I now prioritize relationships, community, and well-being over material possessions.
