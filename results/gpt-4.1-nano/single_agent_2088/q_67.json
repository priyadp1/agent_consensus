  "question": "As I read another list of statements, for each one, please tell me whether you completely agree, mostly agree, mostly disagree or completely disagree with it...The state controls too much of our daily lives.",
  "options": [
    "Completely agree",
    "Mostly agree",
    "Mostly disagree",
    "Completely disagree"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the level of government control varies depending on the context and the specific aspects of daily life. While some regulations and policies are necessary for the functioning and safety of society, excessive intervention can restrict personal freedoms and individual decision-making. In my opinion, the government should strike a balance, but often, it seems to exert more control than necessary, which can undermine personal autonomy and innovation.\n\nANSWER: B"
