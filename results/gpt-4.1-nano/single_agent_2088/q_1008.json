  "question": "Would you like to see the U.S. remain the only military superpower or would it be better if [Europe | the EU ], China or another country became as powerful as the U.S.?",
  "options": [
    "U.S. only superpower",
    "Better if another country became as powerful as U.S."
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe it is important for global stability and peace that power is more evenly distributed among nations rather than concentrated in a single superpower. When multiple countries or regions share substantial influence, it tends to encourage cooperation, diplomacy, and a balance that can prevent aggressive dominance or conflicts. Relying solely on the U.S. as the dominant military power may lead to international tensions and an imbalance that could be destabilizing in the long run. Therefore, I think it would be better if another country, like the EU or China, became as powerful as the U.S., fostering a multipolar world where power is shared among several major players. \n\nANSWER: B",
