While some individuals in these regions are highly religious, Western countries are generally known for their diverse beliefs and secular societies. Thus, it would be a broad generalization to think that being devout is characteristic of most people in these countries. Therefore, I do not primarily associate devoutness with Western countries as a whole.\n\nANSWER: B",
