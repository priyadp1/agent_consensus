  "question": "I am going to read you the same list.  Does...honest elections are held regularly with a choice of at least two political parties...describe our country very well, somewhat well, not too well or not well at all?",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the statement best describes our country as somewhat well, because while we do have regular elections and multiple political parties, there are still concerns about election fairness, intimidation, or barriers that prevent it from fully representing a healthy democratic process. Therefore, it does not seem to capture the full strength of our electoral system but indicates some level of fairness and choice. \n\nANSWER: B"
