        "raw_output": "I believe that giving the European Union more authority over the national budgets of member countries can help promote financial stability and accountability across the union. It could ensure that all member states adhere to fiscal discipline, especially during economic crises. However, this increased authority might also limit the ability of individual countries to make independent financial decisions tailored to their unique circumstances. Balancing the benefits of collective oversight with national sovereignty is essential. Considering both the potential for enhanced stability and the importance of maintaining national control, I lean towards supporting the idea to some extent, provided safeguards are in place. \n\nANSWER: A",
