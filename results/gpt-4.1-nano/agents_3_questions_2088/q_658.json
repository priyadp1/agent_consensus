        "raw_output": "Hosni Mubarak was a long-standing leader of Egypt who maintained a relatively stable relationship with international partners for many years. However, his administration was also marked by authoritarian practices, limited political freedoms, and internal unrest culminating in his resignation in 2011 following widespread protests. Given this complex history, confidence in his ability to make the right decisions regarding world affairs is difficult to fully endorse. Many might have viewed him as maintaining stability, but concerns about his governance cast doubt on whether he could truly prioritize the broader interest of world affairs. Therefore, I would lean towards a cautious perspective regarding his effectiveness in this area.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Hosni Mubarak was a long-serving leader of Egypt who maintained a close alliance with Western countries and played a significant role in regional politics. However, during his later years in power, there was widespread criticism of political repression and lack of democratic freedoms, which cast doubt on his ability to prioritize broader international concerns over domestic control. Given his authoritarian style and the eventual upheaval during the Arab Spring, confidence in his judgment regarding world affairs would likely be low among many international observers. Therefore, I would choose not too much confidence, reflecting skepticism about his capacity to act in the global interest.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Given the historical context, Hosni Mubarak's long tenure as Egypt's president was marked by a focus on maintaining Egypt's stability and sovereignty. While he was viewed as a key regional ally, his leadership was often criticized for authoritarian practices and lack of democratic reforms. His approach to world affairs was primarily centered on Egypt's national interests, and during his rule, Egypt maintained close relations with Western countries, especially the United States, which indicates a pragmatic approach to international relations. However, due to concerns about governance and human rights issues, confidence in his leadership on the global stage might be limited for some people. Therefore, I would choose a moderate level of confidence, acknowledging his influence but also considering the criticisms and limitations of his leadership.\n\nANSWER: B",
