        "raw_output": "The Tamarod Alliance gained prominence during the political upheavals in Egypt, especially around the time of the 2013 protests against the Muslim Brotherhood and President Morsi. It was perceived by many as a grassroots movement advocating for political change and institutional reform. However, opinions about Tamarod are quite divided; supporters see it as a necessary force for change, while critics often view it as aligned with certain political agendas or as instrumentalized by specific powers. Given the mixed perceptions and the formal nature of the alliance, I might lean toward a somewhat favorable view, acknowledging its role but recognizing its controversial aspects.\n\nANSWER: B",
