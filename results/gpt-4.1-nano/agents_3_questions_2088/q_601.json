        "raw_output": "I believe the availability of movies, TV, and music from different parts of the world has increased more than ever over the past five years. With the rise of global streaming platforms, digital distribution, and the internet's reach, audiences now have easier access to international content than they did five years ago. This broader access reflects a significant growth in cultural exchange and availability.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe the availability of movies, TV, and music from different parts of the world has increased somewhat more over the past five years. This is primarily due to the proliferation of streaming platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and other services that offer extensive international content, making diverse media more accessible globally. Additionally, improvements in internet infrastructure and content licensing have expanded the reach of international media. However, the extent of this increase varies depending on regions, so it feels more like a noticeable but not \"a lot more\" change for most people.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe that the availability of movies, TV, and music from different parts of the world has become significantly more accessible over the past five years, largely due to the expansion of streaming platforms and digital distribution. This increased access has led to a noticeable rise in diverse content being easily available to global audiences, making it more than just a little or somewhat more than before. Therefore, I think it has happened a lot more. \n\nANSWER: A",

While streaming platforms and digital content have undoubtedly expanded international access, the change feels substantial but not widespread enough to be considered a lot more. It seems to be a noticeable improvement, but not to the extent that it has dramatically transformed global media consumption for everyone. \n\nANSWER: B",

The proliferation of global streaming services, digital platforms, and social media has significantly expanded access to international content for viewers everywhere. This has led to a much broader and more diverse range of cultural offerings being readily available compared to five years ago. Therefore, I choose option A.\n\nANSWER: A",
