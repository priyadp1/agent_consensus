  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "I believe that abortion is a complex moral issue that depends heavily on individual circumstances and beliefs. For some, it may be morally acceptable under certain conditions, such as to protect the health or well-being of the pregnant person, while others may see it as morally unacceptable regardless of the situation. Because of this complexity, I think it is best understood as a situation-dependent issue.\n\nANSWER: D",
