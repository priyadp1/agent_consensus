    "Moderately big problem",
    "Small problem",
    "Not a problem at all",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Communal relations are fundamental to social cohesion and stability. When communities have strong, positive relations, it contributes to safety, mutual support, and national unity. Conversely, poor communal relations can lead to conflicts, divisions, and a breakdown of trust, which can undermine societal progress. Given the importance of social harmony in maintaining a functional and peaceful society, I believe issues related to communal relations are often quite significant. They can sometimes be understated but have widespread implications.\n\nANSWER: A",
