        "raw_output": "I believe that Egypt should aim for a model similar to Turkey today. Turkey's approach to secularism maintains a separation between religion and state while allowing space for religious expression, fostering a balance that can support social cohesion and modernization. In contrast, Saudi Arabia's more theocratic system places religion at the core of government, which may limit individual freedoms and diversity of thought. For a diverse and evolving society like Egypt, adopting a balanced approach that respects religious beliefs without allowing them to dominate government seems most conducive to national development and social harmony.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that Egypt should pursue a model more akin to Turkey today, as it balances a degree of religious influence with a commitment to secular governance and democratic processes. Turkey's approach allows for religious expressions within a framework of modern institutional rules, promoting social cohesion while maintaining some openness to diverse ideas. Saudi Arabia, with its strict theocratic governance, may restrict individual freedoms and limit political pluralism, which could hinder social and economic development in Egypt. Therefore, adopting a model that encourages religious inclusion without compromising secular governance seems more suitable for Egypt's diverse society and future progress.\n\nANSWER: A",

Turkey maintains a secular government with a separation of religious influences from political affairs, which can promote inclusivity, stability, and modern development. In contrast, Saudi Arabia's model is heavily rooted in religious authority, which may limit social progress and individual freedoms.
