  "question": "(How much of a role do you think Islam plays in the political life of our country - a very large role, a fairly large role, a fairly small role, or a very small role?) In your opinion - is this good or bad for our country?",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad",
    "Neither (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The role of Islam in our country's political life can influence societal values, laws, and governance structures. A significant role might ensure that policies are aligned with religious principles, which some may see as promoting moral integrity and stability. Conversely, it could also risk marginalizing those of different beliefs or reducing the separation between religion and state. Whether this is good or bad depends on how it impacts democratic principles, inclusivity, and individual rights. Ultimately, a balanced approach that respects religious beliefs while maintaining secular governance is ideal for fostering social harmony and ensuring fair representation for all citizens.\n\nANSWER: C"
