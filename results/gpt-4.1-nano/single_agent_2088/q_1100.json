  "raw_output": "Trade unions have historically played a significant role in advocating for workers' rights and improving labor conditions. In many countries, they have contributed positively by securing fair wages, safe work environments, and reasonable working hours, which benefit society as a whole. While some may argue that they can sometimes lead to conflicts or resistance to modernization, the overall influence of trade unions tends to be beneficial if balanced properly. Considering these factors, I believe their influence generally supports fair and equitable progress in the country.\n\nANSWER: B",
