        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that taking military action in Iraq to end Saddam Hussein's rule could be justified if it leads to establishing democracy and preventing further human rights abuses. Historically, Hussein's regime was responsible for severe atrocities, and removing him might promote stability and peace in the long term. However, I also recognize that military interventions carry significant risks, including loss of life and regional destabilization. We should carefully weigh these factors, but given the severe repression under Hussein, I lean toward supporting intervention to restore human rights and security in Iraq.\n\nANSWER: A",
