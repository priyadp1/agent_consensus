  "question": "If Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, do you think they would be likely to...attack another Muslim country, or not?",
  "options": [
    "Yes, likely",
    "No, not likely"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "My reasoning is that Iran's historical stance and regional policies tend to emphasize defending its sovereignty and supporting fellow Muslim countries, rather than initiating aggression against them. Developing nuclear weapons might be seen as a deterrent rather than an offensive tool aimed at other Muslim nations. Therefore, it seems less likely that Iran would attack a fellow Muslim country if it developed nuclear weapons.\n\nANSWER: B",
