Generally, many people see the U.S. as a significant global power that often follows through on commitments, but at times its reliability can be questioned due to shifting foreign policies or disagreements on international issues. Overall, considering the mixed opinions and occasional doubts, it seems most people would classify the U.S. as somewhat reliable rather than very reliable, but definitely more dependable than not at all. Therefore, I believe the most fitting option is B.\n\nANSWER: B",
