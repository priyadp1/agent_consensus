While international aid and leadership are important, an excessive or inefficient level of intervention can sometimes lead to unintended consequences or dependencies. Striking a balance is crucial, and there is room for the U.S. to focus more on sustainable, collaborative solutions rather than overextending itself. Therefore, I think the U.S. might be doing too much at present and should reassess its approach to global issues.\n\nANSWER: A",

While international aid and cooperation are important, there are instances where the U.S. intervenes excessively, sometimes leading to unintended consequences or overshadowing local solutions. Balancing aid with respect for sovereignty and promoting sustainable development could lead to more effective and equitable outcomes.
