    "No confidence at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Hu Jintao was known for promoting stability and economic growth for China, but his leadership was also characterized by limited transparency and concerns over human rights issues. Regarding world affairs, especially in terms of international diplomacy and cooperation, confidence may be tempered by skepticism about China's approach to global issues under his presidency. Therefore, I would choose some confidence, recognizing his efforts but also acknowledging certain limitations and concerns.\n\nANSWER: B",
