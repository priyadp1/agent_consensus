        "raw_output": "I believe the statement does not accurately describe our country because, in reality, the judicial system often treats people differently based on their socioeconomic status, race, or other factors. While the idea of equality before the law is ideal, many individuals perceive that disparities and biases exist, making the system not as fair and uniform as it should be. Therefore, I would select \"not too well\" as it acknowledges some efforts towards fairness but recognizes ongoing issues.\n\nANSWER: C",

While the system may aim to be fair, in practice, disparities and biases can undermine this ideal, leading many to view it as not being entirely just or consistent.

While some believe it treats everyone equally, a significant portion of the population feels it falls short in this regard. Considering these factors, I would say the system somewhat aligns with the idea, but it does not fully meet the ideal of equal treatment for all.\n\nANSWER: B",

Evidence of disparities based on race, socioeconomic status, and other factors suggest that fairness and uniformity are often lacking.
