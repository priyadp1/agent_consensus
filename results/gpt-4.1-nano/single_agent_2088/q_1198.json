  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The police can have a significant impact on the country's stability and safety. If the police are effective, respectful of citizens' rights, and maintain order, their influence tends to be positive. However, if there are issues such as corruption, abuse of power, or inability to enforce laws fairly, their influence can contribute to social problems and mistrust. Based on the general public sentiment in many contexts, the influence of the police is often viewed with skepticism or concern due to these challenges. Therefore, I believe the influence is somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C",
