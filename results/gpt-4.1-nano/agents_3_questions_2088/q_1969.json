        "raw_output": "TEPCO's response to the March 11th earthquake and tsunami has been widely regarded as insufficient and criticized for its delayed and inadequate actions. The company faced significant challenges in managing the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, including poor communication, lack of preparedness, and failures in containing the nuclear crisis. These issues led to prolonged radiation releases, evacuations, and distrust among the public. Given these factors, their overall response is generally seen as lacking effectiveness and failing to meet the needs of those affected in a timely manner.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "TEPCO faced significant criticism for its response to the March 11th earthquake and tsunami, particularly regarding its handling of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Initially, there were issues with transparency, communication, and the effectiveness of their measures to contain the nuclear crisis. The company was slow to provide accurate information about radiation levels and the severity of the situation, and its efforts to stabilize the reactors and decommission the plant have been prolonged and challenging. While TEPCO has since taken steps to improve safety protocols and decontamination efforts, the initial response was widely regarded as inadequate, causing long-lasting public distrust.\n\nANSWER: C",

While they managed to stabilize and contain some of the issues over time, the impact of their early actions contributed to prolonged concerns about safety and environmental contamination.
