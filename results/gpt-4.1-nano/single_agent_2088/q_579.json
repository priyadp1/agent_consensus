  "question": "Do you favor or oppose making the following the law in your country...punishments like whippings and cutting off of hands for crimes like theft and robbery?",
  "options": [
    "Favor",
    "Oppose"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I oppose implementing such harsh physical punishments because they can be inhumane and may violate human rights standards. Modern, fair legal systems tend to favor rehabilitative approaches and due process over cruel and irreversible punishments. Additionally, evidence suggests that severe physical punishments may not effectively deter crime and could lead to further social issues. Therefore, I believe these punishments should not be made law.\n\nANSWER: B"
