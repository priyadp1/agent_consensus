  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Many people believe that Japan has made significant efforts to apologize for its actions during World War II, including official statements and expressions of remorse. However, some feel that these apologies have not been sufficient or were not accompanied by meaningful actions to address past harms and reconcile fully. Others argue that Japan has already apologized enough and that continued demands or apologies are unnecessary. Considering the complexity of historical reconciliation, I think that while Japan has made earnest efforts, there remains room for further sincere actions to fully address past grievances.\n\nANSWER: B",
