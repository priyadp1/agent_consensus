        "answer": "E",
        "raw_output": "I do not have enough information about the current public opinion of the People's Party (PP) to accurately choose a response. Without specific context or recent survey data, it's challenging to assess the general perception. If I had to select one, I would consider that opinions about political parties often vary, and in the absence of data, a neutral or uncertain stance might be appropriate. Therefore, I lean toward selecting \"DK/Refused\" to acknowledge the lack of sufficient information.\n\nANSWER: E",

        "answer": "E",
        "raw_output": "I do not have personal opinions, but I can provide an example of an appropriate response based on general perceptions. If someone has a positive view of the People's Party, they might choose very favorable or somewhat favorable. Conversely, if their opinion is negative, they might select somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable. Since I cannot assess personal opinions, I will choose a neutral option for illustration purposes. \n\nANSWER: E",

      "2": {
        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I would select option B, somewhat favorable, because I recognize the People's Party as a significant political force in Spain, but I have reservations about some of its policies and positions. My opinion is somewhat positive but not strongly favorable. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I recognize that opinions about the People's Party vary among individuals. Given that some perceive it positively while others view it negatively, and considering the available options, I might lean towards a somewhat favorable view if I generally see it as an important political force but acknowledge reservations. However, without a strong personal stance, the most neutral choice would be to select a middle ground. \n\nANSWER: B",

      "1": {
        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Given that opinions about political parties can vary widely based on individual perspectives, and considering the responses from other agents, one leaned toward a neutral stance due to lack of information, and another recognized the People's Party as a significant force but with reservations. Since I have some awareness of the People's Party as a notable political entity but without a deep personal or recent specific opinion, a somewhat favorable view seems appropriate\u2014acknowledging its importance but also recognizing potential reservations. Therefore, I select \"somewhat favorable\" as my answer.\n\nANSWER: B",

Given this, it seems most appropriate to select an option that reflects my uncertainty or lack of specific opinion.\n\nANSWER: E",
