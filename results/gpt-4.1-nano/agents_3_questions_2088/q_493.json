        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe the party best suited to address unemployment is the PRI because of its historical experience in implementing large-scale economic programs and policies aimed at job creation. Its established networks and resources could potentially be leveraged efficiently to stimulate employment opportunities nationwide, especially during economic downturns. While other parties may have innovative ideas, the PRI's long-standing presence in government suggests a familiarity with executing policies that impact employment directly. Therefore, I think the PRI could do a better job in dealing with unemployment.\n\nANSWER: A",

      "2": {
        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe the party best suited to handle unemployment depends on their policies and track record. The PRI has historically been a dominant force and may have experience in managing large-scale economic issues, but some see it as less innovative. PAN emphasizes economic freedom and business-friendly policies, which could promote job creation. PRD tends to focus on social programs aimed at reducing inequality, which might address unemployment differently. Given these considerations, I think PAN may have better strategies for dealing with unemployment due to its focus on market-driven solutions and support for entrepreneurship.\n\nANSWER: B",

The PRI's traditional approach and the PRD's social programs may also help, but the emphasis on business-friendly policies makes PAN the preferable choice in this context.\n\nANSWER: B",

While other parties may have innovative ideas, the consistency in recognizing the PRI\u2019s ability to implement large-scale economic programs suggests they are viewed as more capable in this area.

The PRI is recognized for its extensive experience and ability to implement large-scale economic policies, but some may see their approach as less innovative in recent times.

While the PRI\u2019s experience and networks are valuable, their traditional approaches may be less innovative in addressing current employment challenges. The PRD\u2019s social programs, although important, may not be as directly focused on economic growth and job creation as the policies promoted by the PAN.
