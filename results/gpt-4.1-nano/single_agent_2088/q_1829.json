  "raw_output": "I believe Bill Clinton's international policies had a mix of successes and challenges. He was involved in important peacekeeping efforts, such as in the Middle East and Northern Ireland, and helped bring about good economic relations with other countries. However, there were also criticisms of interventions and policies that some viewed as overly interventionist or lacking clear foresight. Overall, I lean toward approving of his international policies because they aimed to promote peace and economic stability, even if imperfectly executed.\n\nANSWER: A",
