        "raw_output": "The issue of large numbers of people moving from one country to another can be perceived differently depending on various factors such as the country's economic situation, social integration capacity, and security concerns. Some may see it as a major threat if it strains public services or leads to social tensions. Others might view it as a minor or not a threat if it contributes to cultural diversity and economic growth, or if the country has effective migration management policies. Overall, many tend to see migration as a complex issue that doesn't necessarily pose a direct major threat but warrants careful management. Therefore, I consider it a minor threat.\n\nANSWER: B",

While some see migration as beneficial or manageable, others view it as a potential threat that could strain resources or alter cultural dynamics.

        "raw_output": "In my opinion, large numbers of people moving from one country to another can pose various challenges such as economic strain, pressure on resources, and social integration issues. While migration can bring benefits like cultural diversity and economic growth, the scale and management of such movements determine whether they become a significant concern. If migration is unregulated or occurs in large, uncontrolled flows, it could become a major threat; otherwise, it may be a minor or no threat at all. Therefore, I believe this issue is context-dependent, but generally, it can be a major threat if not properly managed.\n\nANSWER: A",
