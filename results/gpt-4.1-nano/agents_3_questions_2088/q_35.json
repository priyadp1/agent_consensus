        "raw_output": "I believe that monitoring communications from American citizens is unacceptable unless it is done with proper legal oversight and suspicion of criminal activity. Privacy is a fundamental right, and unchecked surveillance can infringe on personal freedoms and civil liberties. While national security is important, it should not come at the expense of individual privacy rights without adherence to due process and safeguards. Therefore, broad monitoring without cause tends to undermine trust in government and can lead to abuses of power. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Monitoring communications of American citizens raises important questions about privacy and security. On one hand, surveillance can help prevent threats and protect national security; on the other hand, it can infringe upon individual privacy rights and liberty. In my opinion, it is unacceptable for the government to conduct such monitoring without strict oversight, clear legal protections, and transparency to prevent abuse or unwarranted intrusion into people\u2019s private lives. Protecting civil liberties is essential, and any surveillance should be balanced carefully with privacy considerations to maintain citizens' trust and freedom. Therefore, I believe it is unacceptable for the government to monitor communications from American citizens without proper safeguards.\n\nANSWER: B",
