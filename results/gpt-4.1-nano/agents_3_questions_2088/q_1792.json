Over the past decade, Russia has increased its involvement through military interventions, support to regimes, and diplomatic engagement, notably in Syria and various regional conflicts. This expansion suggests that Russia plays a more significant role today compared to 10 years ago, when its presence was relatively less pronounced.

While other global powers like the United States and regional actors also play significant roles, Russia's strategic moves have significantly elevated its importance, making it more influential today.\n\nANSWER: A",
