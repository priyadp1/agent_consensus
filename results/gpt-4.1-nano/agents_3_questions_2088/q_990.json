        "raw_output": "I believe that the United States' power and influence is a major threat because its dominant global position can lead to increased geopolitical tensions, interfere with other countries' sovereignty, and foster an imbalance of power that may destabilize international relations. Although its influence can also promote stability and economic growth, the potential for overreach and unilateral actions makes it a significant concern. Therefore, I see it as a major threat to my country.\n\nANSWER: A",

While the U.S. is a dominant global power with significant influence over international affairs, its actions do not necessarily threaten my country directly or universally. Instead, its influence often shapes alliances and policy decisions that can have mixed effects, making it not inherently a threat but something to monitor carefully.\n\nANSWER: B",
