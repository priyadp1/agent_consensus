        "raw_output": "My opinion on this policy depends on my views about immigration and economic impact. If I believe that allowing more undocumented immigrants to work and stay in the U.S. benefits the economy and provides opportunities for those already contributing, I might approve. Conversely, if I have concerns about resource allocation, legality, or social integration, I could disapprove. Since the question asks for my overall view after hearing about the proposal, and I may have mixed feelings or insufficient information, I might lean toward being unsure or cautious. Therefore, I would choose to express uncertainty with \"Don't know/Refused.\"\n\nANSWER: C",

The agents' responses suggest some are unsure or leaning towards disapproval, but as a general stance on such policies, a cautious approach would be to disapprove if I have reservations.
