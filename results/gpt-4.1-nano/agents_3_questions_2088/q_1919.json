Over the years, he has emphasized the importance of addressing climate issues through policies such as rejoining international agreements like the Paris Accord and promoting clean energy initiatives. While some may question the pace or scope of his actions, his administration has prioritized climate change as a key focus, which supports a moderate level of confidence in his ability to manage this complex challenge.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "My confidence in Joe Biden's ability to deal effectively with global climate change is limited because, despite efforts to promote clean energy policies and re-entering international agreements like the Paris Accord, climate policy remains complex and contentious. Publicly, Biden has taken steps to address climate issues, but the magnitude and urgency of global climate change require sustained, bipartisan effort and significant policy implementation, which may not yet be fully realized or effective. Therefore, I am somewhat confident that he can handle this challenge, though I recognize the difficulties involved.\n\nANSWER: B",

While he has taken steps to prioritize environmental issues and has rejoined the Paris Agreement, the complexity of global climate policy, the need for international cooperation, and political opposition in the U.S. make it challenging to be highly confident. Therefore, I am somewhat confident that he can manage this issue effectively, but I recognize the hurdles involved.\n\nANSWER: B",
