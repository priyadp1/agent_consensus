While there have been periods of cooperation, such as economic ties, cultural exchanges, and dialogue on regional issues, there are also significant sources of tension, including border disputes, strategic rivalry, and differing global ambitions. This interplay results in a relationship that cannot be simply classified as one of cooperation or hostility, but rather as one that encompasses elements of both, fluctuating over time depending on specific circumstances and issues.\n\nANSWER: C",

On the one hand, they share economic ties, trade, and cultural exchanges that foster cooperation. On the other hand, longstanding border disputes, strategic rivalry, and geopolitical tensions introduce elements of hostility.
