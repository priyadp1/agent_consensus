However, there are concerns about how these resources would be used, including the risk of corruption or misuse, and whether this approach might lead to human rights violations. Additionally, some may question if such measures address the root causes of drug trafficking or if alternative strategies might be more effective. Considering these aspects, I believe assistance should be carefully evaluated with appropriate oversight to ensure it leads to positive, sustainable outcomes.  \nANSWER: A",
