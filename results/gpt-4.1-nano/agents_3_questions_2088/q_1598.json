        "raw_output": "I believe the TTIP could be beneficial because it has the potential to boost economic growth, create jobs, and strengthen international cooperation between the U.S. and the EU. A well-crafted trade agreement can open up markets, reduce tariffs, and promote fair trade practices, which ultimately can be good for the country's economy. However, I am aware that such agreements can also raise concerns about regulatory standards, job security, and environmental protections, so I think it's important to carefully consider the specifics of the deal. Overall, if negotiated transparently and inclusively, TTIP could be a positive development for our country.\n\nANSWER: A",
