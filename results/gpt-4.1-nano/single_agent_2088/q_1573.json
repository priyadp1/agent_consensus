  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe not having the Euro as our currency has been a good thing because it allows us to maintain greater control over our monetary policy, enabling us to respond more effectively to our specific economic conditions. This independence can help in managing inflation, unemployment, and other economic challenges more flexibly than if we were bound by the Euro zone policies. Additionally, avoiding the Euro can protect us from potential financial crises originating within the Euro zone that could negatively impact our economy. Overall, maintaining our own currency seems to have provided us with advantages that support our economic sovereignty and stability.\n\nANSWER: A",
