While the ISI has played a significant role in national security and counterterrorism efforts, its involvement in political affairs and alleged clandestine activities have led to perceptions of negative influence and instability. Therefore, on balance, many consider its impact to be more harmful than beneficial, contributing to uncertainty and possibly undermining democratic processes. \n\nANSWER: D",

        "raw_output": "The influence of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Pakistan is widely viewed as complex and multifaceted. Some consider its role crucial in maintaining national security and stability, thus viewing its influence as somewhat good. Others criticize its involvement in political matters and external operations, leading to perceptions of a somewhat bad or very bad influence. Overall, public opinion tends to be divided, but many recognize the ISI's significant impact on the country's affairs, often with concerns about transparency and accountability. Given this context, the influence is more perceived negatively than positively by a substantial portion of the population.\n\nANSWER: C",

While some argue that the agency has contributed to national security and stability by countering threats, others believe its activities sometimes lead to internal instability, diplomatic tensions, or undermine democratic processes. Given this mixed perception, I think the influence is more often viewed negatively, especially by critics who point to potential overreach or involvement in controversial activities.
