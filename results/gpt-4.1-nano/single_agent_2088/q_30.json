  "question": "For each statement, please tell me whether you completely agree with it, mostly agree with it, mostly disagree with it or completely disagree with it...Russia/Lithuania should be for Russians/Lithuanians.",
  "options": [
    "Completely agree",
    "Mostly agree",
    "Mostly disagree",
    "Completely disagree"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that countries should serve all their citizens regardless of ethnicity, nationality, or ethnic background. Policies based solely on ethnicity may lead to discrimination and undermine principles of equality and human rights. Therefore, the idea that Russia or Lithuania should be specifically for Russians or Lithuanians appears exclusionary and problematic. I mostly disagree with that view.\n\nANSWER: C"
