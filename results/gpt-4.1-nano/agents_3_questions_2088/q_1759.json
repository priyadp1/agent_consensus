        "raw_output": "I believe the differences between the US and European countries are more rooted in their underlying values rather than just policies. Values influence long-term societal attitudes, cultural norms, and core beliefs that shape policy decisions over time. Policymakers often implement policies based on shared values, so discrepancies in values tend to lead to broader differences in approaches and priorities. While policies can differ due to political choices or immediate circumstances, the fundamental values provide the deeper explanation for why those policies vary across regions. Therefore, I see the core divergence as stemming from different societal values rather than merely policy decisions.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I believe that differences between the US and European countries primarily stem from their underlying values rather than policies alone. Values shape priorities, cultural norms, and societal attitudes, which in turn influence policy choices. While policies can be adapted quickly in response to specific issues, they tend to reflect deep-seated values that differ between these regions. For example, Europeans generally prioritize social welfare and collective well-being, whereas Americans often emphasize individual freedom and market-based solutions. These core differences in values make it challenging to reconcile policies without addressing underlying beliefs and cultural norms first.\n\nANSWER: A",
