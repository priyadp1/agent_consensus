        "raw_output": "Since 1991, my country has experienced rapid modernization, economic development, and social change, which have led to shifts in how spiritual values are perceived and practiced. These changes sometimes diminish traditional spiritual practices and community-based values, as materialism and individualism become more prominent. While some individuals find that new influences enrich their spiritual lives, many feel that the core spiritual values have been weakened or displaced, leading to a perception that these changes have negatively impacted spiritual values overall.

        "raw_output": "The changes since 1991 have led to a complex impact on spiritual values. On one hand, modernization and globalization have challenged traditional beliefs, leading some to feel that spiritual values are diminished or undermined. On the other hand, there have been movements emphasizing spirituality, religious revival, and moral discourse, indicating that spirituality remains important for many. Overall, I believe these changes have had a generally negative effect on spiritual values as they have contributed to secularization and the erosion of traditional practices in some areas, though not entirely destroying spiritual life.

On the other hand, there has also been a resurgence of interest in spiritual and religious values as people seek meaning and stability amidst rapid societal change.

While modernization and globalization have exposed people to diverse beliefs and lifestyles, they have also contributed to a decline in traditional spiritual practices and community-centered faiths. Although there is some resurgence of interest in spiritual and religious pursuits among certain groups, the overall trend suggests that many core spiritual values have been weakened or marginalized in everyday life. This gradual erosion points towards a largely negative impact on spiritual values, as they seem less central to societal identity and personal practice compared to the past.\n\nANSWER: C",
