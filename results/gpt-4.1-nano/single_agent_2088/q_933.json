  "raw_output": "I believe moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem was a significant step that acknowledged Jerusalem as Israel's capital, aligning with the historical and religious importance of the city. This move was intended to strengthen U.S.-Israel relations and was supported by many who see Jerusalem's status as central to peace negotiations. However, it also sparked concerns about regional stability and the impact on peace efforts. Overall, I approve because I see it as a bold move that reflects U.S. recognition of Jerusalem's significance, despite potential diplomatic challenges.\n\nANSWER: A",
