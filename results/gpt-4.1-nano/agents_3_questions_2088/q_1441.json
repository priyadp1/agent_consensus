        "raw_output": "I believe that evaluating the government\u2019s handling of Japan\u2019s recovery from the 2011 disaster is complex, as it involves multiple facets such as disaster response, rebuilding efforts, economic support, and long-term resilience planning. Over the years, there have been both commendable initiatives and criticisms regarding the pace and transparency of recovery efforts. While some progress has been made in rebuilding infrastructure and aiding affected communities, challenges remain in ensuring sustainable development and supporting all affected citizens adequately. Considering the overall efforts and ongoing challenges, I lean towards disapproval, as I feel the response could have been more comprehensive and swift in addressing the needs of the people affected. \n\nANSWER: B",
