  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the most significant concern is that a free trade agreement could lead to job losses or a decrease in workers' wages. Protecting employment stability and fair wages is often a top priority for many citizens because economic downturns or wage suppression directly affect individuals and families. While unfair advantages and lowering safety standards are serious issues, the immediate impact on employment and income tends to be viewed as the most pressing problem for the country's overall well-being.\n\nANSWER: C"
