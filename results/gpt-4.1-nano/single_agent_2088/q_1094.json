    "Agree",
    "Disagree"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that drone strikes are typically carried out with some level of government approval, either officially or covertly, due to the sensitive nature and strategic interests involved. However, there are instances where such operations might be conducted without formal authorization, leading to public speculation about the transparency and legality of these actions. Given this complexity, I lean toward disagreeing with the statement that all drone strikes are done without the approval of the Pakistani government, as there is usually some form of consent or indirect approval involved. Therefore, I choose to disagree.\n\nANSWER: B",
