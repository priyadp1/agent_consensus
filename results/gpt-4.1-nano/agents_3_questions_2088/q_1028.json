        "raw_output": "I believe countries that currently do not possess nuclear weapons should be prevented from developing them to maintain global stability and reduce the risk of nuclear conflict. The proliferation of nuclear weapons increases the likelihood of them falling into malicious hands or being used inadvertently, which could have catastrophic consequences. Implementing strict controls and international agreements helps foster peace and security for all nations.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that countries currently without nuclear weapons should be discouraged from developing them. The proliferation of nuclear weapons increases the risk of global instability, accidental use, or escalation into wider conflicts. It is important for international security that such weapons remain limited to a controlled group of nations, with rigorous verification and disarmament efforts. Preventing new countries from acquiring nuclear arsenals helps maintain global peace and stability.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Developing nuclear weapons poses significant risks to global security and stability. Allowing countries to pursue nuclear armament could lead to increased tensions, arms races, and the potential for nuclear conflict. Although some nations may seek nuclear capabilities for deterrence or national security reasons, a collective international effort to prevent proliferation can help maintain peace and reduce the danger of nuclear proliferation spreading further. Therefore, it is important to enforce non-proliferation treaties and discourage the development of nuclear weapons by countries that currently do not possess them.\n\nANSWER: A",
