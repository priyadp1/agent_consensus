        "raw_output": "Closing the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay is a complex issue. Many people see it as a necessary step toward restoring American values and adhering to human rights standards, as the detention facility has been criticized for indefinite detention without trial and potential violations of legal norms. Others argue that closing it could compromise national security, especially if detainees are transferred elsewhere or released without proper oversight, possibly increasing the risk of terrorism. My personal view leans toward supporting the closure, as it aligns with principles of justice and human rights, and I believe alternative detention strategies can be implemented to keep the country safe. Therefore, I approve of this policy.\n\nANSWER: A",
