  "question": "Now thinking about Iraq, regardless of what you think about the original decision to use military force in Iraq, do you now believe that efforts to establish a stable democratic government in Iraq will definitely succeed, probably succeed, probably fail, or definitely fail?",
  "options": [
    "Definitely succeed",
    "Probably succeed",
    "Probably fail",
    "Definitely fail"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "Considering the complex challenges Iraq faces, including political instability, sectarian divisions, and ongoing violence, it seems unlikely that efforts to establish a stable democratic government will definitely succeed in the near future. While there is hope and some progress has been made, the likelihood of failure appears more probable given the persistent difficulties and setbacks. Therefore, I believe that efforts to establish a stable democratic government in Iraq will probably fail.\n\nANSWER: C"
