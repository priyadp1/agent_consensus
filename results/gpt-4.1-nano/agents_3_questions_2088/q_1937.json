North Korea is a significant threat to regional stability and U.S. interests in Asia, and supporting allies in times of crisis helps maintain credibility and deterrence. Not intervening could embolden North Korea and undermine regional security. However, the decision must be carefully weighed considering the potential costs and consequences.

If an Asian ally such as Japan, South Korea, or the Philippines were to face a serious military conflict with North Korea, using military force could be necessary to uphold commitments and deter further aggression. Engaging militarily might also prevent escalation, protect innocent lives, and reinforce our strategic interests in the region.
