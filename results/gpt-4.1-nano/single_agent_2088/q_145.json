  "question": "Some people in our country feel that democracy is a Western way of doing things that would not work here - others think that democracy is not just for the West and can work well here. Which comes closer to your opinion?",
  "options": [
    "Western way / Cannot work here",
    "Can work here"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe that democracy can work well here because it is a versatile system that can be adapted to different cultural and social contexts. While it originated in the West, its core principles of participation, representation, and individual rights are universal and can be implemented effectively in our country with tailored approaches. Dismissing democracy as solely Western overlooks the potential for local development of democratic practices that suit our specific needs. \n\nANSWER: B"
