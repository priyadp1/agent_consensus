  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "In many cultures and families, the influence over how to raise children has traditionally been seen as a joint effort or sometimes as leaning more towards women, given their primary caregiving role. However, the level of influence can vary significantly depending on cultural norms, societal expectations, and family dynamics. In some settings, men may have substantial influence, especially if decisions are viewed from a broader perspective or if traditional gender roles are highly emphasized. Therefore, a reasonable assumption is that influence is often shared or somewhat balanced, but there can still be variations. Given the options, recognizing the potential for shared influence aligns best with contemporary diverse family structures.\n\nANSWER: C",
