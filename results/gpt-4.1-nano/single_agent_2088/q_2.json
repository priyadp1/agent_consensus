  "question": "Do you think China will replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower in the next 10 years, the next 20 years, the next 50 years, or do you think China will not replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower?",
  "options": [
    "Next 10 years",
    "Next 20 years",
    "Next 50 years",
    "China will not replace U.S."
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "I believe that while China is rapidly growing economically and militarily, surpassing the U.S. as the world\u2019s leading superpower within the next 10 years seems unlikely due to the scale of political, economic, and technological factors involved. Over the next 20 years, China might come closer to challenging U.S. dominance, but a complete replacement within this timeframe still appears uncertain given the current geopolitical complexities. Over 50 years, significant shifts could occur, but predicting such a distant future is inherently uncertain. Considering these factors, I think it is unlikely that China will replace the U.S. as the leading superpower in the next 50 years.\n\nANSWER: D"
