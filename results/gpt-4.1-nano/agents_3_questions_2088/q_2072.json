        "raw_output": "I believe that the formal education system in many countries often falls short in equipping individuals with practical skills and entrepreneurial training necessary to start a business. While foundational knowledge is provided, there is frequently a gap in real-world applications, such as financial management, marketing, and legal aspects of entrepreneurship. Consequently, many aspiring entrepreneurs may find themselves lacking specific competencies, which can hinder their ability to launch and sustain a successful business. This indicates that the current system may not fully meet the needs of those looking to become entrepreneurs.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "In my view, the formal education system often emphasizes theoretical knowledge and standardized curricula that may not fully address the practical skills required to start a business. While some programs and courses aim to foster entrepreneurial skills, access and quality vary widely, and many individuals learn entrepreneurial skills through experience outside of formal schooling. Therefore, the system may not comprehensively equip people with all the necessary skills and training to start a business effectively.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "The effectiveness of formal education in equipping individuals with entrepreneurial skills varies greatly depending on the country's education policies, curriculum design, and emphasis on practical training. In many cases, traditional education systems tend to focus more on theoretical knowledge rather than practical skills like business-starting competencies, which can limit their ability to prepare students for entrepreneurship. However, some countries have integrated business and entrepreneurship courses, mentorship programs, and practical internships into their curricula, which can enhance readiness. Overall, while there may be a foundation of general skills, many individuals might still feel they lack the specific knowledge and practical training needed to successfully start a business without additional learning or experience.\n\nANSWER: B",
