        "raw_output": "I believe that religion can play an important role in shaping a nation's moral values and cultural identity, but this influence should be balanced to ensure respect for pluralism and the separation of religion and state. Thus, Islam should have a meaningful but not dominant role in political life, fostering ethical guidance without overpowering democratic principles or minority rights.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe the role of religion in politics should be limited to ensure a separation between faith and state governance. While respecting religious beliefs, it\u2019s important that public policies serve the diverse population fairly and inclusively, rather than being driven primarily by religious doctrines. This promotes equality, pluralism, and prevents the potential marginalization of those who might not share the same faith. Therefore, I think a fairly small role is appropriate in our country's political life.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe that religion should have a limited role in politics to ensure that government remains inclusive and respects the diverse beliefs of all citizens. While religious values can inform moral frameworks, it is important for laws and policies to be based on secular principles that protect individual rights and promote social cohesion. A very large or fairly large role of Islam could risk marginalizing people of different faiths or those with no religious beliefs, potentially leading to divisions within society. Therefore, I think religion's role should be balanced and not dominate political decision-making.\n\nANSWER: D",
