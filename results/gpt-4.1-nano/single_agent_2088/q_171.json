    "Minor threat",
    "Not a threat"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Iran's nuclear program is a significant concern because of the potential for proliferation and regional destabilization, which could indirectly impact U.S. security interests. While it may not pose an immediate existential threat, the possibility of nuclear weapons development by Iran increases tensions and poses challenges to international diplomacy and security. Therefore, it should be considered a major threat due to its potential long-term consequences and regional implications.\n\nANSWER: A"
