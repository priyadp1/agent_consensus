        "raw_output": "In many societies, traditional gender roles often influence family decision-making, especially regarding how to raise children. Historically, women tend to be more involved in day-to-day child-rearing and therefore may have more influence in decisions about upbringing. Although this can vary depending on cultural norms and individual family dynamics, many studies suggest that women generally hold more sway in these decisions. Nonetheless, in some households, especially where gender roles are more egalitarian, influence might be shared equally. However, given the common trends, the most typical pattern is that women have more influence.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "In many traditional family settings, the decision-making process regarding how to raise children has historically been influenced more by women, as they are often primary caregivers and involved more directly in day-to-day parenting. However, with evolving gender roles and increased involvement of men in child-rearing, the influence can vary significantly depending on cultural context and individual families. Nonetheless, in general societal patterns, it is often observed that women tend to have more influence over these decisions.\n\nANSWER: B",

However, this is shifting in some societies toward more shared or egalitarian roles. While influence may vary depending on cultural, social, and individual factors, historically and broadly speaking, women tend to have more influence in decisions related to child-rearing due to their involvement and societal expectations.
