        "raw_output": "China's response to the coronavirus outbreak has been viewed with a mix of admiration for the speed of initial containment measures and criticism over transparency and handling of information. While the government implemented strict lockdowns and mobilized resources rapidly, some observers felt there was a lack of early transparency, which affected the global response. Considering this nuanced perspective, I believe China's effort can be seen as somewhat good but with significant issues that prevented it from being very good. Therefore, I would choose somewhat good as the most appropriate rating.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "China implemented strict lockdown measures early in the outbreak and coordinated public health responses, but it also faced criticism for transparency issues and delays in information sharing. Overall, their efforts were notable but imperfect, and some may view their handling as somewhat effective while others see areas that could have been better managed. Given these mixed evaluations, I would lean toward rating their response as somewhat good, considering the initial efforts and containment measures.  \nANSWER: B",

However, some praise the country's rapid construction of healthcare facilities and mobilization of resources. Overall, considering the mixed evaluations, I believe China has done a somewhat bad job due to concerns over transparency and initial response. \n\nANSWER: C",
