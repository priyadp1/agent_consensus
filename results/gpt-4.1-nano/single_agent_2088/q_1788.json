  "question": "Would you say that U.S. aid to Egypt is mostly military aid, mostly aid to help Egypt develop economically or both equally? ",
  "options": [
    "Mostly military",

    "Both equally"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "U.S. aid to Egypt has historically been heavily skewed towards military assistance, especially since the Camp David Accords, to maintain regional stability and support Egypt's military capabilities. While there are economic development programs included, the majority of aid has been allocated to military hardware, training, and security cooperation. Therefore, it is more accurate to say the aid is primarily military, even though some economic aid exists. \n\nANSWER: A",
