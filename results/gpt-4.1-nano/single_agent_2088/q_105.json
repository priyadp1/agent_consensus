  "question": "Here are some reasons given for using military force against Iraq. As I read a reason, tell me if it is a very important, fairly important, or not important reason to justify the use of military force against Iraq.  If we learned that Iraq helped the terrorists attack the United States on September 11th, would that be a very important reason, fairly important reason, or not important reason to justify the use of military force against Iraq?",
  "options": [
    "Very important reason",
    "Fairly important reason",
    "Not important reason"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "If Iraq helped terrorists attack the United States on September 11th, it would directly threaten national security and pose a clear justification for military action. This reason would be very important because it relates to the safety of the country and its citizens. Such a connection to terrorism would be a compelling justification for using force.\n\nANSWER: A"
