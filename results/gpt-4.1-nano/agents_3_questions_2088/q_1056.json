        "raw_output": "In my opinion, it is better if another country, such as Europe or China, becomes as powerful as the U.S. rather than the U.S. remaining the only superpower. A multipolar world with multiple strong nations can promote balance, encourage cooperation, and reduce the risks of unilateral actions that could lead to conflicts or instability. When multiple powers coexist at similar levels of strength, global stability may be enhanced because countries are motivated to collaborate and prevent dominance by one entity. Additionally, diverse perspectives and approaches can foster innovation and constructive solutions to common challenges. Monopolization of military power by a single country could increase the potential for conflicts, whereas a balanced distribution of power might contribute to a more stable and peaceful international environment.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe it is beneficial for global stability and security if power is distributed among multiple countries rather than concentrated solely in the U.S. Having a balance of power with other nations like Europe or China achieving significant military strength can act as a deterrent to unilateral actions and reduce the risk of conflicts caused by one superpower dominance. It encourages cooperation, accountability, and prevents any single country from wielding overwhelming influence that might lead to instability or militarism. Therefore, fostering a multipolar world where multiple nations have comparable military capabilities is ultimately better for a peaceful international order.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "In my view, it is preferable for other global powers like Europe or China to develop military capabilities comparable to the U.S. rather than the U.S. remaining the sole superpower. A multipolar world can promote stability through balance, reduce the risks of unilateral actions, and foster international cooperation. When multiple countries hold significant military influence, it encourages diplomatic solutions and shared responsibilities, decreasing the likelihood of conflicts driven by dominance struggles. While a superpower can provide strong leadership, unchecked dominance can also lead to global tensions and instability. Therefore, fostering a competitive yet balanced international security environment appears more beneficial for long-term peace and stability.\n\nANSWER: B",

When multiple countries such as Europe, China, or others develop comparable military capabilities, it creates a balance of power that discourages unilateral or aggressive actions by any single nation, including the U.S. Maintaining dominance solely with the U.S. can lead to tensions and conflicts driven by power struggles. Encouraging a more distributed military strength fosters diplomatic cooperation, accountability, and reduces the risk of conflict caused by over-concentration of power.
