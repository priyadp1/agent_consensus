        "raw_output": "I believe the influence of the MQM (Muttahida Qaumi Movement) is somewhat bad in our country. Historically, the MQM has been a prominent political party representing urban Sindh, particularly Karachi. While the party has played a significant role in advocating for the rights of an urban population and contributing to political debates, its influence has often been associated with political unrest, violence, and allegations of promoting ethnically divisive policies. Such issues can hinder national unity and stability, affecting overall development negatively. Therefore, their influence is more harmful than beneficial in the current context.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The influence of the MQM (Muttahida Qaumi Movement) in our country has been a subject of debate. Some perceive their contributions to regional development and political participation as beneficial, which could be viewed as somewhat good. However, there have also been concerns about their involvement in political violence, authoritarian tendencies within the party, and the impact on social cohesion. Considering both positive and negative aspects, their overall influence leans more towards causing instability and division than fostering progress. Therefore, their influence is somewhat bad.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The influence of the MQM (Muttahida Qaumi Movement) on our country has been complex and controversial. Some view the party as having contributed to promoting the rights and welfare of certain communities, helping to address regional disparities and giving a voice to marginalized groups. Others criticize the MQM for involvement in political violence, corruption, and destabilizing political processes, which have often hindered national stability and development. Overall, its impact appears mixed, with the negative aspects potentially outweighing the positive in recent years. Considering these factors, the influence seems to lean more towards causing societal and political instability, which is detrimental to the country's progress.\n\nANSWER: D",
