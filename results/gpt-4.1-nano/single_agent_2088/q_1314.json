  "question": "Do you think the partnership between the U.S. and Western Europe should remain as close as it has been or do you think that Western Europe should take a more independent approach to security and diplomatic affairs than it has in the past?",
  "options": [
    "Remain as close",
    "More independent"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the partnership between the U.S. and Western Europe should remain as close because maintaining strong alliances enhances collective security, economic stability, and global influence. Close cooperation allows for shared intelligence, coordinated responses to threats, and a unified stance on international issues. While encouraging Western Europe's independence in certain areas is beneficial, an overly distant relationship could weaken the effectiveness of addressing common challenges. Therefore, a close partnership continues to be the most advantageous approach for mutual interests and global stability.\n\nANSWER: A",
