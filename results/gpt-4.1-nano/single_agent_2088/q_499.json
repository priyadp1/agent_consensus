  "question": "And which comes closer to describing your view? The United States promotes democracy wherever it can, OR the United States promotes democracy mostly where it serves its interests?",
  "options": [
    "The United States promotes democracy wherever it can",
    "The United States promotes democracy mostly where it serves its interests"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the United States's promotion of democracy is often motivated by a combination of ideals and interests. While it might genuinely aim to spread democratic values, strategic and geopolitical interests frequently influence where and how assistance is provided. Consequently, the U.S. tends to support democracy more actively in contexts that align with its national interests, such as regional stability or economic benefits, rather than universally. Therefore, I lean toward the view that its promotion is mostly driven by its interests.\n\nANSWER: B"
