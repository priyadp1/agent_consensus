        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can have mixed effects on employment: it may create jobs in some sectors due to increased exports and global opportunities, but it can also lead to job losses in industries that face stiff competition from imports. Overall, the impact depends on the country's economic structure and policies, making it difficult to say that trade definitively leads to only job creation or only job losses. Many people perceive it as a complex issue where the effects are nuanced and situation-dependent.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can have mixed effects on employment in a country. On the one hand, it can create jobs by opening new markets for domestic goods and encouraging investment. On the other hand, it can lead to job losses in industries that are unable to compete with foreign imports, especially in sectors where production becomes cheaper abroad. Overall, the impact depends on the specific industries, policies, and economic conditions, but in general, the effects are often balanced or vary over time, making it difficult to assert a clear-cut outcome. Therefore, I believe trade with other countries does not make a definitive difference in the overall employment situation.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can have mixed effects on employment. While it may create jobs in sectors that are competitive internationally or open new markets for local products, it can also lead to job losses in industries that can't compete with cheaper imports or offshoring. Overall, the impact depends on various factors such as the structure of the economy, policies in place, and the types of goods and services involved. Therefore, the effect is not uniform across all situations, making it difficult to definitively say it always leads to job creation or losses. It generally does not make a significant difference either, as many countries experience both positive and negative effects simultaneously. \n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can indeed have complex effects on employment. While it can create jobs by opening new markets and encouraging investment, it can also lead to job losses in sectors that face stiff foreign competition. Overall, the impact varies depending on economic structures, policies, and the specific industries involved. Given that respondents suggest these effects often balance out or cancel each other, the most accurate choice is that trade does not necessarily lead to a clear-cut outcome of either job creation or losses.\n\nANSWER: C",

While some sectors may benefit from increased exports and access to new markets, others may suffer due to competition from cheaper imports or offshoring. Because of this nuanced and situation-dependent impact, it is difficult to definitively state that trade always results in either only job creation or only job losses. Therefore, I believe the most accurate response is that it does not make a significant difference overall.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "Trade with other countries can have varying effects on employment, creating new opportunities in some sectors while causing losses in others. The overall impact depends heavily on specific industries, policies, and economic conditions of the country. Since these effects tend to offset each other and can change over time, it is difficult to definitively state that trade solely leads to job creation or job losses. Therefore, I agree that trade with other countries does not make a clear-cut difference in the overall employment situation.\n\nANSWER: C",

While some industries may benefit from increased exports and new markets, others might suffer due to competition from imports or manufacturing shifts abroad. These opposing effects tend to balance out overall, making it difficult to say that trade universally results in either only job creation or only job losses.
