        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that Islamic extremism, in my understanding, is more closely associated with advocating for the legal imposition of strict Shari'ah on all Muslims. This view emphasizes the desire to enforce religious law through legal means, which can be seen as a radical approach to religious governance. While violence may be involved in some extremist actions, it is not necessarily inherent to the concept for me. Therefore, my perspective aligns more with option A.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I understand that Islamic extremism, in my view, tends to involve actions that threaten peace and security, often through violence and aggressive measures. While some may interpret it as advocating for strict religious laws, the use of violence to eliminate non-Muslim influences reflects a more extreme and militant stance. Since the question asks for the option that comes closer to this understanding, I interpret it as emphasizing violent actions rather than purely legal demands. Therefore, I choose the option that aligns with the use of violence to achieve goals related to non-Muslim influences.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "My understanding of Islamic extremism leans more towards the use of violence to pursue political or ideological goals that challenge existing social and legal structures. While advocating for strict Shari'ah laws can be associated with extremist views, the term often involves the willingness to use force or violent methods to achieve those aims or to remove influences seen as incompatible with their interpretation of Islam. Therefore, the description that emphasizes violence to eliminate non-Muslim influences aligns more closely with the typical conception of extremism, which frequently involves violent acts as a means of advancing their objectives. \n\nANSWER: B",
