  "question": "Does our government go along with U.S. policies too much, not enough, or deal with the U.S. just about right?",
  "options": [
    "Go along too much",
    "Not enough",
    "Deal with the US about right"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The extent to which the government aligns with U.S. policies reflects a balancing act between sovereignty and international cooperation. If the government is seen as overly submissive or willing to follow U.S. policies without sufficient independent judgment, it would be considered going along too much. Conversely, if it is resistant or uncooperative, it may not be engaging enough. Ideally, a proportional approach ensures national interests are met while maintaining constructive relations. Based on general perceptions of sovereignty and diplomatic relations, I believe the government is generally handling the U.S. relationship about right.\n\nANSWER: C",
