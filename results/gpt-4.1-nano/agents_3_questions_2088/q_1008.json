Concentrating power in a single nation can lead to instability and increase the risk of conflict, so a more balanced distribution of influence is preferable for long-term global stability and peace.\n\nANSWER: B",

A world with balanced power among several nations tends to promote peace and shared responsibility, rather than concentration of military strength in one country.\n\nANSWER: B",

However, a multipolar world where other nations like the EU or China have comparable power can also encourage cooperation and prevent any single country from wielding unchecked dominance. Promoting a balanced distribution of power could lead to more peaceful and equitable international relations. Ultimately, I think a globally balanced power structure might best serve humanity\u2019s interests.\n\nANSWER: B",
