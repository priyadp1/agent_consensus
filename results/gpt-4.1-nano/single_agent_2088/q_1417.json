  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I tend to trust European standards more when it comes to food safety because the European Union has very strict regulations and thorough approval processes for food products, often emphasizing extensive safety testing and consumer protection. Their regulations tend to be comprehensive, and the precautionary approach is quite rigorous, which increases my confidence in their standards. While American standards are also robust, I perceive European standards as slightly more stringent and protective in this area.\n\nANSWER: A",
