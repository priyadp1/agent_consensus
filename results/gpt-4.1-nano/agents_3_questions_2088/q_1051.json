Since I do not have current or specific data on the attitudes toward Muslim Bulgarians, I will base my response on typical patterns of public opinion surveys which often show mixed or cautious attitudes toward minority groups. Given the sensitivity and varying opinions, many people might hold mostly unfavorable views, although some may be favorable. Considering the potential for societal divisions and the tendency for negative stereotypes to persist, I will select the option indicating a somewhat unfavorable perception. \n\nANSWER: C",
