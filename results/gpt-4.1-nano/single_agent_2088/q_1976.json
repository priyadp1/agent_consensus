    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Given the current international stance and U.S. foreign policy, the United States is generally committed to defending its national interests and allies. If a serious military conflict were to arise between the U.S. and China, it is highly probable that the United States would consider the use of military force to protect its interests and security. Historically, the U.S. has shown a willingness to engage militarily when its core interests or national security are threatened, especially in a conflict involving a major geopolitical player like China. Therefore, I believe the most likely response would be that the U.S. would use military force.\n\nANSWER: A",
