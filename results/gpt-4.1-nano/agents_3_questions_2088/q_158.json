        "raw_output": "I followed the news about the U.S. military operation that killed Osama bin Laden quite regularly during the time of the event, as it was a major international story and a significant moment in recent history. However, since then, my attention has decreased, and I haven't kept up with detailed updates continuously.

However, over time, my attention has lessened, and I haven't maintained continuous or detailed coverage since then.

Although my attention may have lessened since then, I still stayed somewhat engaged with the key updates and reports, indicating that I was closely following the news during the initial phase and maintained some interest afterward.
