        "raw_output": "I am somewhat pessimistic that the Middle East will become more democratic, mainly because many governments in the region have shown resistance to democratic reforms and often prioritize maintaining their power over democratic principles. While U.S. policies can influence the region\u2014such as through diplomatic pressure, support for civil society, or military aid\u2014they are not the sole factor. The complex historical, cultural, and political dynamics within Middle Eastern countries play a significant role in their paths toward or away from democracy. U.S. policies can either help or hinder these efforts, but ultimately, the regional factors are pivotal. Therefore, I believe the outcome is influenced partly by U.S. policies but mostly by internal regional factors.\n\nANSWER: B",

While U.S. policies can influence regional stability, they have at times supported authoritarian regimes or intervened in ways that do not necessarily promote democratic development, which contributes to my skepticism about positive change happening soon.
