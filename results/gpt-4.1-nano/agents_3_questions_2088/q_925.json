While progress has been made over the years, significant obstacles remain that make success uncertain. Given the current situation, it seems more likely that efforts will face setbacks rather than guaranteed success, but total failure also appears unlikely if sustained efforts continue. Therefore, I believe it is more probable that these efforts will probably succeed rather than definitely succeed or definitely fail.\n\nANSWER: B",

While progress has been made at times, recent history suggests that achieving long-term stability is uncertain and may take significant time and effort, making the likelihood more aligned with a probable success rather than a certain one.
