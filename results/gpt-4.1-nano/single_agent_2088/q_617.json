  "question": "Do you think the people of Iraq will be better off or worse off in the long run than they were now that Saddam Hussein has been removed from power by the US and its allies?",
  "options": [
    "Better off",
    "Worse off"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "The removal of Saddam Hussein has the potential to lead to positive political change and greater stability if it paves the way for democratic governance. However, it also risks increasing instability and violence in the short term, which could hinder long-term development. Given the uncertainty, I believe that the long-term prospects are more likely to improve as Iraq builds new institutions and experiences increased freedom. \n\nANSWER: A"
