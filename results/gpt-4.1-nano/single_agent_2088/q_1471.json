  "question": "Do you think the Pakistani government actively supports extremist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, does it tolerate these groups, or does it oppose these groups?",
  "options": [
    "Actively supports",
    "Tolerates",
    "Opposes"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The question of whether the Pakistani government actively supports, tolerates, or opposes groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba is complex. Officially, the government denies supporting these groups, and many international entities consider Pakistan to have taken steps to crack down on them. However, there are longstanding accusations and perceptions that elements within the state or its security apparatus have, at times, tolerated or indirectly supported such groups for strategic purposes, particularly in regional conflicts. Overall, given the official stance and the efforts made to curb militant activities, it appears that the government does not actively support these groups but may tolerate some level of their existence. Therefore, I believe the government mainly tolerates these groups.\n\nANSWER: B",
