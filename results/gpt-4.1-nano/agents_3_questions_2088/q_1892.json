        "raw_output": "The UK's departure from the EU has brought both positive and negative implications. On one hand, it allows the UK to have greater control over its laws, borders, and trade policies, which could benefit certain sectors and foster more tailored economic strategies. On the other hand, it can lead to economic uncertainties, disruptions in trade, and possible diminished influence on the global stage. The overall impact varies depending on economic sectors, regional interests, and societal perspectives. Given the complex nature of the consequences, it is reasonable to view the effects as a mix of both, making it not strictly good or bad for the UK as a whole.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The UK's departure from the European Union has both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, it allows the UK to regain sovereignty, tailor policies more independently, and potentially reduce contribution to EU budgets. Conversely, it may also lead to economic uncertainties, trade disruptions, and challenges in international cooperation, which could negatively impact the country's economy and global influence. The overall effect depends on how well the UK manages the post-Brexit transition and adapts to new circumstances, making it difficult to categorize definitively as purely good or bad. Given the complexity and the differing perspectives, it's reasonable to select the \"Both\" option to acknowledge the nuanced impact.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The decision on whether Brexit is beneficial or detrimental for the UK depends on various factors. Supporters argue that leaving the EU allows the UK to regain sovereignty, tailor trade agreements to its needs, and reduce bureaucratic constraints. Conversely, critics highlight potential economic drawbacks, such as disruptions to trade, investment, and increased costs for businesses. Given these mixed perspectives and the ongoing impact of Brexit, it is challenging to definitively categorize it as solely good or bad. Therefore, I believe the outcome could be both, depending on the specific context and perspective.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The impact of the UK leaving the EU encompasses both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, the UK gains greater sovereignty, more control over domestic laws, and the ability to establish independent trade agreements tailored to its interests. On the negative side, it faces potential economic disruptions, trade barriers, and uncertainty that could harm its economic stability and international relationships. Given these contrasting effects and the complex nature of the outcomes, it is logical to recognize that Brexit has both good and bad consequences depending on perspective and circumstances.\n\nANSWER: C",

On the positive side, it offers the UK greater sovereignty over laws, borders, and trade negotiations, potentially allowing for policies better suited to national interests. Conversely, it has introduced economic uncertainties, trade disruptions, and some decline in influence on the global stage. Given this mixture of outcomes and perspectives, it is difficult to classify the overall impact as purely good or bad; instead, it encompasses both advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, I believe the most accurate reflection of the situation is that the effects are both positive and negative depending on the context.\n\nANSWER: C",
