        "raw_output": "I believe that requiring UN approval before using military force could strengthen international cooperation and legitimacy, which are important for long-term peace and stability. However, it might also delay swift action in urgent situations, potentially putting our country's security at risk. Balancing the need for international consensus with the ability to respond promptly is complex, but I think having some form of prior approval could help ensure our actions are globally supported and justified. Ultimately, I think the added procedural step might often prove too cumbersome when quick decision-making is necessary, so I lean toward it making international threat response more difficult.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it may sometimes slow down decision-making, ensuring widespread support is crucial for long-term peace and effective resolution of international threats.
