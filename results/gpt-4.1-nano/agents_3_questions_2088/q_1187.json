When such conflicts are frequent or intense, they can undermine trust in institutions, impede policymaking, and lead to political uncertainty. However, the severity of this problem varies depending on the context; in some countries, it may be a major obstacle to effective governance, while in others, it might be a relatively minor issue. Given its potential to destabilize democratic processes and governance structures, I believe it is a very big problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

When such conflicts escalate, they can undermine public trust in institutions and hinder effective governance. Depending on the frequency and severity of these conflicts, they can be seen as a significant obstacle to progress. Therefore, I believe it is a moderately big problem, as it can disrupt the functioning of the government but may not always reach the level of a very big problem unless compounded by other issues.\n\nANSWER: B",
