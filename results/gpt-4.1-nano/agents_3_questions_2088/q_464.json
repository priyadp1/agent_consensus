They can be used to target militants without risking civilian lives on the ground and can act as a deterrent against terrorist activities. However, I also recognize that such attacks might cause unintended harm or diplomatic tensions. Balancing security needs with ethical considerations makes this a complex issue, but overall, if effectively targeted and used within the framework of international law, they can be justified as necessary defensive measures for Pakistan.\n\nANSWER: A",
