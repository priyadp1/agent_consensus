  "question": "In your opinion, would it be a good thing or a bad thing if the European Union becomes as powerful as the US?",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe it would be a good thing because a stronger European Union could lead to more coordinated policies, increased influence on global issues, and greater economic stability within the continent. Such power could help in addressing shared challenges like climate change, security, and trade more effectively. Additionally, fostering a balance of power on the global stage might prevent dominance by a single superpower, promoting a more multipolar world that encourages cooperation and peace. However, it is also important to consider the potential risks of increased centralization, such as erosion of national sovereignty, which must be managed carefully. Overall, if managed wisely, a powerful EU could be beneficial for both Europe and the world.\nANSWER: A",
