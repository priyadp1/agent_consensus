        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe China's growing military power is a significant concern because it could shift the regional balance of power and challenge U.S. interests and security. This development may lead to increased tensions, arms races, and instability, which could have broader implications for global peace. While some may downplay the issue or see it as manageable, I think it warrants serious attention and caution. Therefore, I consider it a very serious problem.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "China's growing military power is certainly a concern given the potential for regional instability and the impact on global security. It could challenge U.S. dominance and influence in Asia and beyond, possibly leading to increased arms races or conflicts. However, the U.S. has substantial military strength, alliances, and diplomatic tools to manage these challenges. While it is a serious issue that warrants attention, it may not currently be at a level that is classified as extremely urgent or catastrophic. Therefore, I see it as a significant concern, but not an immediate or overwhelming threat.\n\nANSWER: B",

While the U.S. maintains significant military capabilities and alliances, the rapid expansion of China's military could provoke arms races and increase tensions that threaten global security. Considering these factors, it warrants attention and cautious consideration, but it does not necessarily mean immediate catastrophe. Therefore, I see it as a somewhat serious problem.\n\nANSWER: B",

Although it is not an immediate crisis, it requires serious attention to prevent escalation or conflict in the future.

While it may not be an immediate crisis, it has the potential to lead to increased tensions and conflicts if not addressed properly.

While the U.S. still maintains strong military capabilities and alliances, the rapid expansion of China's military could contribute to an arms race and increase tensions globally.
