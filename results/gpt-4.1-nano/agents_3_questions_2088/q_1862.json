        "raw_output": "Using torture to obtain information raises serious ethical and human rights concerns. While the threat of terrorism endangers public safety, resorting to torture undermines fundamental moral principles and can lead to unreliable information, abuses, and broader societal harm. Many believe that effective and lawful methods of investigation should be prioritized over morally questionable practices. Therefore, I believe that such actions cannot be justified, regardless of the circumstances, because they violate human dignity and legal standards.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Using torture against suspected terrorists is a highly controversial practice. Many argue that it violates human rights and moral principles, and that it can lead to unreliable information and abuse of power. Others may believe that in extreme cases, such as imminent threats, it might be justified to prevent larger harm. Therefore, whether it can be justified depends on the specific context and ethical considerations involved.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "The use of torture, even against suspected terrorists to prevent potential attacks, raises serious ethical and human rights concerns. While the goal of ensuring security is vital, torture often leads to unreliable information, violates fundamental human rights, and can undermine the moral integrity of a nation. Most international laws and ethical standards condemn torture, emphasizing non-violent and lawful methods for gathering intelligence. Therefore, such practices cannot be justified, as they contradict principles of humane treatment and legal justice.\n\nANSWER: B",

Even in the context of national security, methods that cause severe harm and are likely to produce unreliable information undermine both ethical standards and the rule of law.

While preventing terrorism is important for national security, resorting to torture risks causing more harm by undermining the rule of law and ethical standards.
