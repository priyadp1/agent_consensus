  "question": "Do you think the UK leaving the European Union will be a good thing or a bad thing for ____? a. the European Union",
  "options": [
    "Good thing",
    "Bad thing",
    "Both (VOL)",
    "Neither (VOL)",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The UK's departure from the European Union could be seen as a bad thing for the EU because it might weaken the unity and economic strength of the bloc, potentially encouraging other member states to reconsider their membership or creating instability within the EU's political and financial systems. On the other hand, some may argue that the EU could be better off without the UK's influence, possibly enabling it to pursue more cohesive policies without external disagreements. Given the overall impact, it seems more likely to be a negative development for the EU's stability and unity, even if there are some potential benefits for reforms. Therefore, I believe it is a bad thing for the EU.\n\nANSWER: B",
