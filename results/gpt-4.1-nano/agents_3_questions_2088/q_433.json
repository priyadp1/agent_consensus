        "raw_output": "The territorial disputes between China and neighboring countries could potentially lead to regional instability or conflict, especially given China's growing influence and military presence in the region. Such disputes might impact international trade, security alliances, and diplomatic relations, making them a significant concern for global stability and the United States' interests. However, they are not currently resulting in open conflict, and diplomatic efforts are ongoing to resolve these issues, which tempers the immediate severity. Therefore, I believe this issue is somewhat serious but not among the most urgent problems facing the country at this time.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe territorial disputes between China and neighboring countries are a somewhat serious problem because they have the potential to lead to regional tensions or conflicts, which could impact stability and security in Asia and beyond. While they are not necessarily immediate threats to the entire country or global peace, these disputes can escalate if not managed carefully. Therefore, I find them to be somewhat serious rather than very serious or not a problem at all.\n\nANSWER: B",
