        "raw_output": "I believe the PRD could do a better job of dealing with corruption because historically, it has positioned itself as a party advocating for social justice and transparency, yet it has also faced its share of allegations and scandals related to corruption. The PRI has a long-standing history with corruption issues, which diminishes its credibility on this front, and the PAN has often focused more on economic policies and governance reform rather than actively tackling corruption. Since the question asks which could do better, the PRD's positioning and recent efforts suggest a potential to improve and take stronger action against corruption, making it the more suitable choice here.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe the party best suited to handle corruption depends largely on their past records and policies. The PRI has historically been associated with corruption scandals, although it has also taken steps toward reform. The PAN has worked to promote transparency and anti-corruption measures, often positioning itself as a cleaner alternative. The PRD tends to focus more on social issues, but its stance on corruption varies. Given the current context and recent efforts to improve accountability, the PAN is perceived by many as having a stronger commitment to fighting corruption. Therefore, I think the PAN could do a better job in this area.\n\nANSWER: B",
