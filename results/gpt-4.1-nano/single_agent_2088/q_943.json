  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the Bharatiya Janata Party may be better positioned to handle reducing terrorism due to its strong national security focus and emphasis on strict measures against terrorism. The party's approach often involves decisive actions and a firm stance on security issues, which some see as effective in tackling threats. Conversely, the Indian National Congress has historically emphasized diplomatic and peace-building strategies, which might be less immediate in addressing active security threats. Therefore, in my opinion, BJP could do a better job in reducing terrorism.\n\nANSWER: A",
