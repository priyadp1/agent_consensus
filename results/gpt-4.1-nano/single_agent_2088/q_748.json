  "raw_output": "My opinion is that immigrants in our country today are no more to blame for crime than other groups. While some may believe that immigrants contribute disproportionately to crime, research generally indicates that immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than native-born citizens. Therefore, I do not think they are more to blame. I believe in viewing crime and social issues with fairness and evidence-based understanding. \n\nANSWER: B"
