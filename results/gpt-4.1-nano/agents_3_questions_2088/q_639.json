        "raw_output": "I believe my country needs more foreign aid because many nations are still facing significant development challenges, poverty, and health crises that require external support. Increasing foreign aid could help address these issues more effectively, improve global stability, and foster positive international relations. Therefore, I think more foreign aid is necessary to support global development and mitigate suffering abroad.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe my country needs less foreign aid because, while international support is important, domestic priorities such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure should be the main focus of our resources. Redirecting some foreign aid domestically could better serve our national interests and strengthen our own development, especially if our country is relatively well-off compared to others. Additionally, ensuring aid is effectively targeted and used for its intended purposes is crucial, and sometimes aid programs face challenges related to efficiency and accountability. Therefore, I think we should reassess and potentially reduce the amount of foreign aid received.\n\nANSWER: B",

While there are important domestic priorities that need attention, international support plays a vital role in addressing global challenges such as poverty, health crises, and environmental concerns. Maintaining a balanced approach ensures that our country contributes to global stability without neglecting our own development needs. Therefore, I think keeping the current level of aid is appropriate.\n\nANSWER: C",
