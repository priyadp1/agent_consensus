        "raw_output": "France has historically played a significant role on the global stage through its cultural influence, diplomatic initiatives, and leadership in international organizations like the EU and UN. Over the past decade, however, its relative influence has experienced some shifts due to changing geopolitical dynamics, emerging powers, and challenges within Europe itself. While France remains an important player, its role may now be viewed as somewhat less prominent compared to a decade ago, especially considering the rise of other global actors and shifting priorities in international affairs. Therefore, I believe France plays a less important role in the world today compared to 10 years ago.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "France has historically played a significant role in international politics, culture, and diplomacy. Over the past decade, its influence has been shaped by both internal developments and external factors, such as global geopolitical shifts and the European Union's evolving dynamics. While France continues to exert considerable influence, some might argue that its relative importance has diminished compared to emerging powers or global institutions. Alternatively, others may see France maintaining its influence in key areas like diplomacy, military alliances, and cultural exports. Overall, I believe France's role remains about as important as it was 10 years ago, given its ongoing contributions and strategic importance in world affairs.\nANSWER: C",

Over the past decade, its influence has evolved due to shifting international dynamics, such as European integration, its stance on global issues like climate change, and its responses to international conflicts. While its role remains substantial, several emerging powers and regional influences have changed the global landscape. Therefore, France's importance in the world today might be slightly less prominent compared to ten years ago, but it still retains considerable influence. \n\nANSWER: B",
