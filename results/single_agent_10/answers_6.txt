Question 6
And thinking about some political leaders and organizations in our country, please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of Rachid Ghannouchi?

My own considered answer would be "Somewhat unfavorable."

Rachid Ghannouchi is a prominent Tunisian politician and leader of the Ennahda Movement, involved in the country's democratic transition. While he has played a significant role in promoting political pluralism and democracy, perspectives on him are mixed. Some view him as a key figure advocating for Islamic political participation, while others have concerns about his influence on secularism and governance. Based on this, I see him somewhat favorably due to his contributions to Tunisia's political development, but with reservations, leading me to choose "Somewhat unfavorable."
