        "raw_output": "Vladimir Putin has historically held more centralized and significant power in Russia's political landscape, especially during his long tenure as President and Prime Minister. Dmitry Medvedev, while having served as President and Prime Minister, has generally been seen as more of a subordinate or close ally to Putin rather than an equal or rival in terms of influence. The concentration of decision-making and strategic control has largely remained with Putin, making him the more powerful figure overall.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Vladimir Putin unquestionably holds more political power in our country. As the long-standing President and Prime Minister, he has maintained a dominant influence over the political landscape, policy decisions, and international relations. Dmitry Medvedev, while having held significant positions such as President and Prime Minister himself, has generally been seen as more of a subordinate figure aligned with Putin\u2019s policies and directives. Therefore, Putin remains the central figure with the most authority and control in our political system.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Vladimir Putin holds significantly more political power in our country due to his long-standing position as the President and previously as Prime Minister. He is recognized as the central figure in Russian politics, with a strong influence over government policies, military decisions, and foreign affairs. Dmitry Medvedev, while having served as President and Prime Minister, appears to have more limited influence compared to Putin, often seen as a close ally or subordinate rather than an equally powerful leader. Therefore, Putin is generally regarded as the primary figure of authority and power in the political landscape of our country.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "Vladimir Putin has maintained a very central and dominant role in Russia's political power structure for many years. His long tenure as President and Prime Minister, along with the perception of him as the ultimate decision-maker, suggests he holds significantly more political influence than Dmitry Medvedev. While Medvedev has held high office, his influence has generally been seen as subordinate or aligned with Putin\u2019s dominant role. Therefore, it\u2019s clear that Putin is the more powerful figure overall.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "Vladimir Putin has maintained a dominant position in Russia's political hierarchy for many years, with centralized control over policy, strategy, and decision-making processes. Although Dmitry Medvedev has held high-level positions such as President and Prime Minister, both analysts and historical patterns suggest that Medvedev operates more as a subordinate or close ally rather than an equal or rival to Putin's influence. The pattern of power dynamics indicates that Putin's authority far surpasses that of Medvedev, making him the more powerful figure overall.\n\nANSWER: A",

Both agents highlight his long-term leadership, central influence, and subordinate role of Dmitry Medvedev, suggesting that Putin holds the dominant authority.
