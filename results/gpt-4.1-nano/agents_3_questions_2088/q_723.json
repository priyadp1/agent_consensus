While some aspects of engagement can bring benefits such as economic growth and cultural exchange, excessive influence might lead to concerns over sovereignty and policy independence. Therefore, whether this influence is good or bad depends on how it aligns with our national interests and values. Balance and transparency are key in ensuring that influence does not undermine our priorities.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "raw_output": "I believe the influence China has on our country is complex and multifaceted. If it exerts a great deal or a fair amount of influence, it could be beneficial in terms of economic partnerships and cultural exchange, which can foster growth and understanding. However, it could also pose challenges related to national security, economic independence, or political sovereignty. Given these nuanced effects, whether this influence is fundamentally good or bad depends on how it is managed and the specific areas it impacts. Therefore, I view this influence as neither inherently good nor inherently bad, but something that requires careful oversight and balanced relations.\n\nANSWER: C",

While some degree of international engagement and economic ties can be beneficial, a significant influence could raise concerns about sovereignty, cultural impact, and policy independence.
