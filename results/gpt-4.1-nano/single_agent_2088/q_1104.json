  "raw_output": "Supporters of Right Sector are often associated with nationalist and far-right ideologies, and their influence can be viewed as controversial. Some see their involvement as a source of strong patriotism and resistance, which might be viewed positively by certain segments of the population. However, many others perceive their influence as divisive, extremist, or destabilizing, which leads to concern about social cohesion and governance. Overall, considering the mixed perceptions and the potential for conflict or instability associated with such groups, their influence is widely regarded as detrimental to the country's progress. Therefore, I believe their influence is more harmful than beneficial.\n\nANSWER: D",
