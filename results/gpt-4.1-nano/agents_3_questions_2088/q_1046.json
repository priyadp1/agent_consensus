        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that avoiding military conflict should take precedence because war often results in significant human suffering, economic disruption, and regional instability. While preventing nuclear proliferation is critically important for global security, the potential costs and consequences of military action can be severe and unpredictable. Engaging in diplomatic solutions, sanctions, and negotiations offers a chance to address concerns while minimizing harm. Therefore, prioritizing avoiding conflict aligns with promoting peace and stability, even if it means accepting the risk of Iran developing nuclear weapons.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons is more important because nuclear proliferation in the region could destabilize geopolitical stability and increase the risk of nuclear conflict. While avoiding military conflict is crucial, the potential long-term dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran outweigh the immediate risks of conflict, especially if diplomatic efforts have been exhausted. Ensuring global security and non-proliferation standards should take precedence over the fear of initiating military action, which could escalate into broader conflict.\nANSWER: A",

Engaging in military action might prevent the development in the short term but could also escalate violence and instability. Avoiding conflict might allow Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, which could have dire consequences, but the long-term goal should be diplomatic solutions that prevent both conflict and proliferation. Striking a balance between security and diplomacy seems essential, but ultimately, stopping nuclear proliferation aligns with international peace and safety.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "I believe that preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, even if it requires military action, is more important because the proliferation of nuclear weapons poses an existential threat to regional and global security. The risk of nuclear conflict or escalation makes it crucial to take proactive measures to prevent their development rather than risk letting Iran potentially acquire these weapons, which could destabilize the region and threaten international safety. Diplomatic efforts should be prioritized whenever possible, but when they fail to prevent nuclear proliferation, decisive action becomes necessary to safeguard peace and security.\n\nANSWER: A",

While military action might achieve disarmament, the potential for escalation into broader conflict and regional instability makes avoiding military conflict the safer and more stable approach in the long run. Diplomatic efforts and sanctions should be prioritized to prevent nuclear development without resorting to warfare.

Engaging in military strikes might temporarily hinder Iran's nuclear development but could also provoke prolonged conflict, undermine diplomatic efforts, and increase global insecurity.
