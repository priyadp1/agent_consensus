  "question": "Do you think the Pakistani government provided intelligence to the U.S. that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden, or don't you think so?",
  "options": [
    "Yes, provided intelligence",
    "No, did not provide intelligence"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "There has been considerable speculation and some reports suggesting that Pakistan may have provided intelligence or at least had knowledge of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts before the raid. Some officials and analysts believe that elements within the Pakistani government or intelligence services possibly shared information that helped locate him, while others argue that Pakistan was not directly involved. Given the complexity and the lack of definitive publicly available proof, it's difficult to conclusively assert that Pakistan intentionally supplied intelligence leading to bin Laden's killing. Nonetheless, the prevailing suspicion and some credible reports favor the idea that Pakistan played a role in sharing intelligence.\n\nANSWER: A"
