  "question": "Do you think conditions in Cuba will improve, worsen, or not change much when Fidel Castro dies?",
  "options": [
    "Improve",
    "Worsen",
    "Not change much"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "The future conditions in Cuba after Fidel Castro's death could go either way, depending on how succession is managed and the country's political and economic reforms. Historically, leadership changes in influential regimes can create instability or opportunities for change. Some believe that without his strong presence, the country might face challenges that could lead to worsening conditions. Others hope that his passing might open pathways to more liberal or improved circumstances due to policy shifts. Given these possibilities, predicting a significant immediate shift is difficult, but generally, political uncertainty suggests conditions might worsen or stay largely the same until new leadership solidifies. \n\nANSWER: C",
