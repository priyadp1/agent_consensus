        "raw_output": "I believe that maintaining strong economic ties with both China and Japan is crucial for the United States, as each plays a vital role in different aspects of the global economy. China is a major trading partner and a significant source of manufacturing and markets for American companies, while Japan has historically been a key ally and technological leader. Prioritizing one over the other could risk economic instability or diplomatic issues. However, if I must choose one, I think that cultivating stronger economic ties with Japan might be more strategically beneficial, given their longstanding alliance, technological innovation, and shared values concerning regional security and stability, which can complement the economic relationship. Balancing relationships with both is ideal, but if limited to one, Japan's role as a reliable partner and technological leader makes it a slight priority.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe it is more important for the United States to have strong economic ties with Japan because Japan has historically been a key trade partner, a leader in technology and innovation, and a strategic ally in the Asia-Pacific region. Maintaining robust economic relations with Japan supports global stability and allows the U.S. to foster partnerships with a country that shares democratic values and a mature economy. While China is a significant economic player, its complex relationship involving competition, geopolitical tensions, and differing political systems makes it crucial for the U.S. to prioritize Japan to ensure a balanced and stable economic future in the region.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Both China and Japan are crucial economic partners for the United States, each playing a significant role in different aspects of global trade and economic stability. Strong economic ties with China can promote cooperation on global supply chains, address shared challenges like climate change, and foster mutual growth despite political tensions. On the other hand, maintaining robust relationships with Japan is vital due to longstanding alliances, technological collaboration, and regional security partnerships, which indirectly benefit economic stability and growth. Prioritizing one over the other could lead to missed opportunities or increased vulnerabilities, so a balanced approach that fosters strong ties with both countries ultimately serves U.S. interests best.\n\nANSWER: C",
