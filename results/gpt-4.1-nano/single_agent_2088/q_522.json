  "question": "Which one of these do you trust the second most to offer you guidance as a Muslim...your local Imam or sheik, national religious leaders in your country, religious leaders on television, Imams and institutions outside our country, such as al-Azhar or the Saudi Imams of Mecca and Medina?",
  "options": [
    "Your local Imam or sheik",
    "National religious leaders",
    "Religious leaders on television",
    "Imams and institutions outside our country, such as al-Azhar or the Saudi Imams of Mecca and Medina"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe I would trust national religious leaders the second most because they are often more connected to the broader community and can provide guidance that aligns with national contexts and issues. They tend to have a wider perspective than local Imams but still maintain a level of authority and credibility that I find reliable. While local Imams are important, their guidance may sometimes be more limited; religious leaders on television might not address individual concerns deeply, and Imams outside the country may not understand the specific cultural and societal nuances of my community. Therefore, for balanced guidance, national religious leaders would be my second choice after my local Imam.\n\nANSWER: B"
