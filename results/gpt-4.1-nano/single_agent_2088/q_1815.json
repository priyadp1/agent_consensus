  "question": "Please tell me whether the FIRST statement or the SECOND statement comes closer to your own views \u2014 even if neither is exactly right. b. Immigrants  in our country today are more to blame for crime than other groups",
  "options": [
    "First statement",
    "Second statement",
    "Neither/both (DO NOT READ)",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the second statement reflects a common misconception that associates immigrants in general with higher crime rates, which is not supported by evidence and can foster negative stereotypes. Since the question asks which statement aligns more closely with my views, and I do not agree that immigrants are more to blame for crime than other groups, I lean towards neither statement being entirely accurate but acknowledge the second statement as more aligned with misconceptions. Therefore, I choose the option that indicates disagreement with the premise that immigrants are primarily responsible for crime. \n\nANSWER: C",
