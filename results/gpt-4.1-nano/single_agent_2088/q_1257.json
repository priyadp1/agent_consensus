  "question": "How much have ordinary people benefited from the changes since 1989/1991- a great deal, a fair amount, not too much, or not at all?",
  "options": [
    "Great deal",
    "Fair amount",
    "Not too much",
    "Not at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Since 1989/1991, many argue that ordinary people have seen only a fair amount of benefit from the changes, as economic disparities and social inequalities persist, and not all population groups have gained equally from the reforms. While there have been improvements in some areas, the overall impact has not been overwhelmingly positive for the majority. Therefore, I believe the benefits are moderate but not extensive.\n\nANSWER: B",
