Some people see this migration as a serious issue due to concerns about border security, resource strain, or legal aspects, which might lead them to view it as a very big problem. Others may see it as a necessary humanitarian movement or a manageable issue, considering it a moderately big or small problem, respectively. Still, some might not see it as problematic at all, perhaps viewing it as a natural aspect of migration or ignoring its significance. Given these perspectives, I believe it is most appropriate to recognize that while it poses challenges, it is not necessarily a very big problem for everyone involved.\n\nANSWER: C",
