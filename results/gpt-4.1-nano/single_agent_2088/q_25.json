  "question": "Would you say that each of the following is doing a very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad, or very bad job dealing with global climate change? b. the public",
  "options": [
    "Very good job",
    "Somewhat good job",
    "Somewhat bad job",
    "Very bad job",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the public has made some efforts to address global climate change but overall still has a long way to go. Many individuals are aware of the issue and participate in activities like recycling and supporting policies, but widespread action and substantial change are still lacking. The collective response seems to be somewhat positive but not sufficient to declare it a very good job. Therefore, I would choose a middle-ground assessment. \n\nANSWER: B"
