  "question": "I'm going to describe various types of political systems and ask what you think about each as a way of governing our country. For each one, would it be a very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad or very bad way of governing this country? e. the military rules the country",
  "options": [
    "Very good",

    "Very bad",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "A military rule could provide stability and order in times of crisis, but it often limits personal freedoms and democratic processes. Such a system may suppress dissent and concentrate power in the hands of a few, which can lead to abuses and instability in the long run. Overall, while it might be effective in certain situations, it is generally not a desirable way to govern a democratic society. \n\nANSWER: D",
