        "raw_output": "If robots and computers take over many current jobs, it could create opportunities for new, higher-paying positions in emerging industries, technological development, or specialized services. This potential for innovation and economic growth makes it plausible that such advances would lead to better-paying jobs. However, this outcome depends heavily on how well the country adapts to technological change and whether new opportunities are accessible and well-distributed. While optimistic about this possibility, some may still doubt whether these new roles will be sufficient or widespread.\n\nANSWER: A",

Historically, technological advancements have sometimes led to the creation of innovative roles that pay well, especially if the economy and policies support such transitions. However, it also depends on how well the country manages the shift, invests in retraining workers, and fosters innovation. Given these considerations, I believe it is likely that new, better-paying jobs will emerge as a result of automation, though this may not be guaranteed everywhere or for everyone.\n\nANSWER: A",
