        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "Considering Japan's energy needs and the environmental concerns associated with fossil fuels, I believe maintaining the current level of nuclear power is the most balanced approach. It provides a reliable energy source while efforts continue to improve safety measures and develop alternative renewable sources. Reducing nuclear power could lead to increased reliance on imports and higher carbon emissions, whereas increasing it might raise safety and environmental risks given past incidents. Therefore, preserving the current level allows for a cautious, steady transition toward cleaner energy.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "In my opinion, Japan should maintain its current level of nuclear power use. While concerns about safety and waste management are valid, nuclear energy provides a significant source of low-carbon electricity that is crucial for Japan's energy security and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Maintaining the current level allows Japan to balance energy needs with safety measures, rather than risking increased reliance on fossil fuels or abrupt reductions that could impact the economy and overall energy stability. Therefore, continuing at the current level seems to be the most balanced approach.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe that the use of nuclear power in Japan should be reduced due to concerns about safety, radioactive waste management, and the potential for future nuclear accidents. While nuclear energy provides a significant amount of low-carbon electricity, recent incidents and the long-term challenges associated with nuclear safety suggest that exploring alternative renewable energy sources would be a better path forward. Reducing nuclear power would also align with increasing public support for safer and more sustainable energy solutions. \n\nANSWER: A",

While safety concerns and waste management are legitimate issues, nuclear energy currently provides a significant and reliable source of low-carbon electricity that supports Japan's energy security and climate goals. Completely reducing nuclear power might lead to increased reliance on fossil fuels, which could undermine efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and compromise economic stability. Therefore, keeping the current level allows Japan to continue benefiting from nuclear energy while addressing safety measures adequately.\n\nANSWER: B",
