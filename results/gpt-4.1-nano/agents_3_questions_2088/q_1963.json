  "question": "Overall, how much influence do you think the United States is having on the way things are going in our country? Would you say it is having a great deal of influence, a fair amount, not too much, or no influence at all? (Ask if 'A great deal' or 'A fair amount':) Is this a good thing, a bad thing, or neither good nor bad?",

        "raw_output": "I believe that the influence of the United States on the country's affairs is significant but not overwhelmingly dominant. A great deal of influence can sometimes lead to positive advancements when aligned with national interests and values, fostering progress and stability. However, it can also result in negative consequences if that influence pushes policies or practices that are not in the best interest of all citizens or undermine local autonomy. On balance, the impact depends on how that influence is exercised and whether it promotes beneficial outcomes or exacerbates issues. Since influence is complex and context-dependent, I see it as neither inherently good nor bad but rather as something that requires careful management.\n\nANSWER: C",

Influence can be beneficial if it leads to positive change, but it can also be detrimental if it results in unnecessary interference or negative consequences.
