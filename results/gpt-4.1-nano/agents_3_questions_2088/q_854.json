This perception may be influenced by reports of corruption, unequal resource distribution, and policies that seem to favor wealthy or powerful entities. While some efforts are made to benefit the broader population, the overall impression is that systemic biases and influence from special interest groups limit the fairness of governance. Therefore, I think it predominantly benefits only a few groups rather than everyone.\n\nANSWER: B",
