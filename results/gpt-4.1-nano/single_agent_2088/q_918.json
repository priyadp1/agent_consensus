  "question": "Does this statement describe your country very well, somewhat well, not too well, or not well at all? d. Most people live in areas where it is dangerous to walk around at night",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The safety of walking around at night varies significantly depending on the country in question. In some countries, crime rates and violence make it truly dangerous to be outside after dark, while in others, urban areas are relatively safe, and most people can walk at night without concern. Since the statement generalizes \"most people\" living in danger zones at night, and considering the global diversity, it is unlikely that it describes every country very well. However, in numerous countries with higher crime rates, it does align with people's experiences. Therefore, I would say it describes the country somewhat well, acknowledging that safety perceptions are mixed and vary significantly across different regions within countries.\n\nANSWER: B",
