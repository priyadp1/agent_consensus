  "question": "What's the greater international threat to our country, Saddam Hussein's continued rule in Iraq, or the continuing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians?",
  "options": [
    "Saddam Hussein's rule",
    "Continued conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians",
    "Equal threats (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the continuing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians poses a greater international threat because it has the potential to destabilize the broader Middle East region, lead to widespread violence, and involve multiple nations. This ongoing conflict also has significant implications for regional security and international diplomacy, making it a more immediate threat to global stability compared to Saddam Hussein's continued rule, which, while dangerous, has been somewhat contained or diminished over time.\n\nANSWER: B",
