        "raw_output": "I believe that the level of hostility towards Muslims among Europeans varies significantly across different countries and communities. While some groups may hold predominantly accepting attitudes, there are also segments that harbor prejudice or hostility, often influenced by factors such as media narratives, political discourse, or social tensions. Overall, it seems that only a minority of Europeans are genuinely hostile toward Muslims, but the perception that it might be more widespread persists in some contexts. Considering this, I would choose the option that best reflects a moderate level of hostility that is not overwhelming but still notable.\n\nANSWER: C",

However, it's unlikely that hostility is widespread enough to be considered the majority; rather, it appears to be a notable segment, possibly reflecting prejudiced attitudes or misunderstandings. Given this, \"many\" seems like the most fitting choice, as it suggests a considerable but not overwhelming share of the population.\n\nANSWER: B",
