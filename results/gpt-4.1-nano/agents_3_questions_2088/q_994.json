        "raw_output": "My opinion on whether President Petro Poroshenko approved or disapproved of his handling of relations with Russia would depend on various political and diplomatic factors during his tenure. If his approach was seen as firm and protective of Ukraine's interests, I might lean towards approval. Conversely, if his dealings appeared too conciliatory or ineffective in asserting Ukraine's sovereignty, disapproval might be more appropriate. Given the complexity of Ukraine-Russia relations and considering the general public sentiment during his presidency, I believe the manner of handling relations was often viewed critically, but there may have been efforts at diplomacy. Therefore, I choose disapprove.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "My opinion on President Petro Poroshenko's handling of relations with Russia depends on various factors, including the geopolitical climate, actions taken to defend national interests, and efforts towards diplomacy. Since relations with Russia have been complex and often tense, some may view his approach as necessary for national security, while others might see room for more conciliatory measures. Given these considerations, I lean toward disapproval due to the ongoing conflicts and challenges in maintaining stable and productive relations.\n\nANSWER: B",

Given the complex and tense history between Ukraine and Russia, some may see efforts to maintain diplomatic ties as positive, while others might perceive recent policies as insufficient or too conciliatory. Overall, I believe that a balanced approach involving strategic diplomacy and defense is essential, but the effectiveness of his leadership in this area has been viewed critically by many. Considering the political and security challenges faced during his presidency, I lean toward disapproval, assuming that more assertive policies might have been necessary or more successful.\n\nANSWER: B",

Despite efforts at diplomacy, the persistent hostilities and unresolved issues suggest that more assertive or strategic measures might have been necessary to protect Ukraine\u2019s interests and security.

Given the ongoing conflict and diplomatic challenges during his tenure, many perceived his approach as too conciliatory or insufficiently firm in defending Ukraine's sovereignty.
