  "raw_output": "Mamnoon Hussain, having served as the President of Pakistan from 2013 to 2018, is viewed differently by various segments of the population. Some appreciate his role in the political landscape, while others question his policies and leadership style. Given the mixed opinions and the generally subdued legacy he has left, I would say that many people may not hold a strongly favorable view of him but may still recognize his position in recent history. Therefore, I lean towards a somewhat unfavorable opinion.\n\nANSWER: C"
