        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "I believe the US decision to try Al Qaeda prisoners before military tribunals can be justified because it allows for a process tailored to national security and wartime circumstances. Military tribunals can be more flexible in handling sensitive information and may provide a more efficient justice process in situations where civilian courts might not be suitable or available. However, it's important that these tribunals uphold fair trial standards to protect individual rights and maintain international legitimacy. Overall, I approve of this approach when it balances security needs with fairness.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe that trying Al Qaeda prisoners before military tribunals can be appropriate in certain contexts, especially when dealing with national security and wartime threats, as it allows for procedures tailored to security concerns and covert evidence that might not be admissible in civilian courts. However, it also raises concerns about fairness, justice, and potential violations of legal rights. Given the importance of upholding legal standards and ensuring the rights of prisoners, I lean toward disapproval to avoid undermining the rule of law. \n\nANSWER: B",

While military tribunals might offer security advantages in certain situations, they also pose risks of violating prisoners' rights and bypassing full judicial oversight. Upholding the rule of law and ensuring fair trials are essential to maintain legitimacy and protect individual rights, even in complex national security contexts. Therefore, I disapprove of this approach unless strict safeguards are in place to ensure justice and fairness.\n\nANSWER: B",
