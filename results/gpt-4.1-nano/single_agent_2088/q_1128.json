  "question": "(Which of the following concerns you most about Islamic extremism in our country today...it is violent, it will lead to people having fewer personal freedoms and choices, it will divide the country, or it will hurt the country's economy?) Which of the following concerns you second most about Islamic extremism in our country today?",
  "options": [
    "It is violent",
    "Will lead to people having fewer personal freedoms/choices",
    "It will divide the country",
    "It will hurt the country's economy",
    "None of these (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe that the second most concern about Islamic extremism is that it will divide the country. While violence is a significant issue, the social cohesion and unity of a nation are equally vital for long-term stability. When extremism fosters division, it can lead to ongoing conflict and weakened societal bonds, which ultimately undermine other aspects like personal freedoms and economic stability. Ensuring national unity addresses some of the root causes and helps prevent further escalation of violence and societal harm. Therefore, I consider division to be the second most concerning aspect.\n\nANSWER: C",
