  "question": "As you may know, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 near the end of World War II. Looking back, would you say using the atomic bomb on Japanese cities in 1945 was justified or was it not justified?",
  "options": [
    "Justified",
    "Not justified"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "The use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki remains a deeply complex and morally challenging topic. Some argue that it was justified as a means to quickly end the war and save lives that would have been lost in a prolonged conflict or invasion. Others contend that the massive civilian casualties and long-term suffering caused by the bombs make their use unjustifiable, emphasizing the importance of alternative diplomatic or military strategies. Considering the devastating human impact and moral implications, I believe the bombings cannot be justified given the profound loss of innocent lives and the suffering inflicted.\n\nANSWER: B",
