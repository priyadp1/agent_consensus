  "question": "Thinking about people in our country who do not have a job, in general would you say this is mostly their own fault or is it mostly because of forces outside their control?",
  "options": [
    "Mostly their own fault",
    "Mostly because of forces outside their control"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "In considering why people might be unemployed, I believe that many factors beyond individual control heavily influence employment status, such as economic downturns, industry declines, or systemic barriers. While personal effort can make a difference, broader economic forces and structural issues often play a larger role in whether someone finds work. Therefore, I think most unemployment results from forces outside individuals' control.\n\nANSWER: B"
