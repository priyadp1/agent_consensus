While individual effort, skills, and education are important, many external forces, such as economic downturns, technological changes, or regional job availability, play a significant role in whether someone can find employment. It is unfair to place the blame solely on individuals, as structural issues in the economy and society can limit opportunities beyond personal control. Therefore, I think that most unemployment is caused by forces outside individuals' control.\n\nANSWER: B",
