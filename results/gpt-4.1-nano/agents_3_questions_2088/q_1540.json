        "raw_output": "My perception is that foreign companies in the mining industry tend to prioritize resource extraction over environmental protection, which often leads to significant environmental damage. This perception is shaped by reports of ecological degradation, pollution, and short-term benefits overshadowing long-term sustainability, leading many to believe they ruin the environment to a considerable extent. I would rate this as fairly high, though acknowledging there may be some responsible operators as well. Therefore, I believe they ruin the environment quite substantially in many cases.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "raw_output": "My perception is that foreign companies in the mining industry tend to prioritize profit over environmental protection, which often leads to significant environmental degradation. This behavior can be attributed to their profit motives and possibly less stringent regulation enforcement. Therefore, I believe that they tend to ruin the environment quite substantially. The option that best captures this view is A because it indicates a strong belief that foreign mining companies are responsible for environmental damage.\n\nANSWER: A",
