        "raw_output": "Hassan Rouhani was Iran's president from 2013 to 2021, known for his more moderate stance and attempts at diplomatic engagement, including negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. Public opinion about him varies greatly depending on perspectives on Iran's domestic policies, international relations, and the impact of his leadership. Given that many Iranians and international observers viewed him as a somewhat moderate figure who was constrained by larger political forces, I might lean towards a somewhat favorable or neutral opinion. However, considering the more critical views from opponents and certain segments of the international community, some may see him more unfavorably. Overall, without strong positive or negative biases, I choose the middle ground.\n\nANSWER: B",
