  "question": "Thinking of Egypt's relationship with the United States, in the future, would you like Egypt to be closer, about as close, or less close to the United States than it has been in recent years?",
  "options": [
    "Closer to the United States",
    "About as close to the United States",
    "Less close to the United States"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe Egypt should maintain a balanced approach to its international relations, fostering cooperation with the United States while also strengthening ties with other countries and regional partners. Being more closely aligned with the U.S. could enhance economic aid and strategic partnerships, but it is equally important for Egypt to preserve its sovereignty and diversify its international relationships. Therefore, I think maintaining a similar level of closeness as in recent years would be beneficial to ensure stability and flexibility in Egypt's foreign policy.\n\nANSWER: B"
