  "question": "In your opinion, should Ukraine remain one, united country, or should regions that want to leave be allowed to secede? ",
  "options": [
    "Remain united",
    "Allowed to secede"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe Ukraine should remain one united country because maintaining territorial integrity fosters national stability, unity, and a shared sense of identity. Allowing regions to secede could lead to fragmentation, increased conflicts, and weaken the country's ability to address internal and external challenges effectively. A cohesive nation is more capable of ensuring security, economic progress, and social harmony for all its citizens.\n\nANSWER: A"
