Question 3
Do you think China will replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower in the next 10 years, the next 20 years, the next 50 years, or do you think China will not replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower?

I believe that China is unlikely to fully replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower within the next 10 years, but over the longer term—perhaps in the next 50 years—it is possible that China could become the dominant global power. Currently, the U.S. maintains significant advantages in military, technological innovation, and global influence. While China's rapid economic growth and increasing geopolitical assertiveness indicate a shift in global dynamics, many structural challenges remain for China, including demographic issues, international relations, and internal reforms. Therefore, I think the most realistic outlook is that China will not fully replace the U.S. in the near future, but may approach or challenge U.S. dominance over a longer horizon.
