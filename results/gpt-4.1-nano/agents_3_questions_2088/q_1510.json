        "raw_output": "Posting links to political stories or articles online can help inform and mobilize others, raising awareness about important issues. However, the actual influence on government actions is often limited because decision-makers are usually less swayed by online content than by organized advocacy, lobbying, or direct engagement. While online sharing may contribute to public discourse and can support collective movements, its direct effect on policy change tends to be moderate. Therefore, I believe it is somewhat effective rather than highly or not at all effective.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "Posting links to political stories or articles online can raise awareness and inform others about important issues, but its direct influence on government actions is often limited. Many policymakers may not see these links or may prioritize other forms of advocacy, and online sharing alone rarely leads to tangible change without broader organizing or direct engagement. Therefore, I believe this method is somewhat effective, as it can contribute to shaping public opinion and encouraging collective action, but on its own, it usually doesn\u2019t drive significant policy change.\n\nANSWER: B",

While it may not always lead directly to policy changes, raising awareness and sparking conversations online can contribute to larger social movements and influence public opinion, ultimately affecting government actions. However, the actual impact depends on how widely the content is shared and how receptive the audience is to the information.  \nANSWER: B",

Sharing information online helps educate the public, raises awareness, and can stimulate discussions. While it may not directly lead to policy changes on its own, raising awareness can contribute to broader social movements and influence public opinion over time. The actual impact depends heavily on how widely the content is circulated and how receptive the audience is, but as a standalone method, it has some value in shaping public discourse rather than directly affecting government decisions.\n\nANSWER: B",
