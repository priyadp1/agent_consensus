  "question": "I am going to read you the same list.  Does...there is a judicial system that treats everyone in the same way...describe our country very well, somewhat well, not too well or not well at all?",
  "options": [
    "Very well",
    "Somewhat well",
    "Not too well",
    "Not well at all"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "I believe the perception of fairness in the judicial system varies among individuals, but overall, many people feel that the system does not treat everyone equally due to issues like bias, inequality, and disparities in access to justice. While there are laws and regulations intended to ensure fairness, operational realities often fall short, affecting public confidence. Therefore, I would say the country treats everyone in the same way somewhat well.\n\nANSWER: B"
