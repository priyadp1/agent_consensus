  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "In my opinion, India's police are not tough enough when it comes to investigating cases of rape. There have been numerous reports and cases where proper investigation and justice have been delayed or denied, which can discourage victims from coming forward and undermine the rule of law. Strengthening investigative measures and ensuring accountability are essential to effectively combat sexual crimes. Therefore, I believe the police need to be more proactive and rigorous in their efforts.\n\nANSWER: B"
