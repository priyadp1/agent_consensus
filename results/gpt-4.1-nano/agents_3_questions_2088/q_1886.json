This is because immigration policies directly impact national security, economic well-being, and social cohesion. While the EU has a role in broader policy coordination, individual member states have unique needs and contexts that are best addressed at the national level. Therefore, I think my country should have the primary say in these decisions.\n\nANSWER: A",

While regional cooperation can be beneficial, sovereignty considerations make it more appropriate for the national government to set migration policies for non-EU citizens. Therefore, I think my country's government should make decisions about migration of people who are not EU citizens into our country.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "answer": "C",
        "raw_output": "I believe that migration is a complex issue that benefits from both national and regional cooperation. Since immigration policies can impact the economy, social cohesion, and security, it seems appropriate for the EU to have a say in decisions regarding non-EU citizens coming into member countries. However, national governments are closer to the specific needs and contexts of their populations, so they should retain primary authority on this matter. Therefore, a collaborative approach, as indicated by both national and EU decision-making, is ideal. \n\nANSWER: C",
