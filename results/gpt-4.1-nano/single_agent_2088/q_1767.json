  "question": "Overall, how much influence do you think Saudi Arabia is having on the way things are going in your country? Would you say it is having a great deal of influence, a fair amount, not too much, or no influence at all? (Ask if 'A great deal' or 'A fair amount':) Is this a good thing, a bad thing, or neither good nor bad?",
  "options": [
    "Good",
    "Bad",
    "Neither"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "I believe Saudi Arabia's influence on our country is moderate, perhaps somewhat significant due to economic and political ties. Whether this is beneficial or harmful depends on the specific circumstances and outcomes, but overall, such influence can contribute to stability and growth or, alternatively, restrict our autonomy. Considering these nuances, I see it as a complex dynamic rather than strictly positive or negative. \n\nANSWER: C",
