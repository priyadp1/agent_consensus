However, it also sparked controversy and criticism both domestically and internationally due to concerns about increasing tensions in the Middle East and the potential impact on peace processes. My approval depends on weighing these factors, but given the importance many attribute to the recognition of Jerusalem and the U.S. government's stance, I lean toward approval of this policy move.",
