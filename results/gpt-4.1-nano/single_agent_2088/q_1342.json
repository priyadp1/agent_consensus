Given his history of pursuing nuclear weapons development and limited openness to diplomatic engagement, many people might lack confidence that he will consistently prioritize global stability or do the right thing. However, some might still hold some hope that he could act responsibly under certain circumstances. Considering this, I\u2019d say that I have some confidence that he might take appropriate actions aligned with peaceful and cooperative international policies, even if uncertain.\n\nANSWER: B",
