  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe that a good democracy is more important because it ensures that the rights and freedoms of individuals are protected, and it fosters a just and equitable society where everyone has a voice. A strong democracy provides the foundation for sustainable development and the fair distribution of resources, which can lead to a healthier economy in the long run. Without a functioning democracy, economic gains may come at the expense of core values and social justice.
