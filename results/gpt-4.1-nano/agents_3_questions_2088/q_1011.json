While societal factors such as economic conditions or access to resources can influence opportunities, ultimately, personal qualities like determination, skills, and decisions often determine outcomes. People have varying degrees of control over their actions, and personal responsibility is crucial in achieving success. Society can provide a framework, but individual effort and choices tend to be decisive factors.\n\nANSWER: B",
