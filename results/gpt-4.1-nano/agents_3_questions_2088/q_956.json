        "raw_output": "The Chinese economy is one of the largest in the world and a major player in global trade, manufacturing, and investment. Fluctuations in its growth rate, policy changes, or economic disruptions can have widespread effects on supply chains, commodity prices, and global markets. Given China's significant role in global economic dynamics, developments within its economy tend to influence other countries to a considerable extent, especially emerging markets and trade-dependent nations. While other factors also impact global conditions, China's economic performance remains a key driver of worldwide economic stability and growth.\n\nANSWER: B",

Changes in China's economic growth, policies, or disruptions can have ripple effects across many countries, affecting exports, investment flows, and commodity prices.

        "raw_output": "The Chinese economy is one of the largest in the world and has integrated deeply into global supply chains, trade networks, and financial markets. As a result, significant changes or disruptions in China\u2014such as shifts in growth rates, government policies, or economic stability\u2014can have ripple effects on global markets, influencing everything from commodity prices to global manufacturing output. While China's influence is substantial, the extent of this impact varies depending on specific economic conditions or events; nonetheless, it generally exerts a considerable influence on international economic conditions. Therefore, it is reasonable to see China's economy as affecting the rest of the world to a considerable degree.\n\nANSWER: B",
