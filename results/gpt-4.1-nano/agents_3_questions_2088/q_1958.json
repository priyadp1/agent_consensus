Privacy rights and sovereignty are important principles that should be respected on the international level. Unwarranted surveillance can lead to distrust and conflicts between nations and violates individual privacy rights.

        "raw_output": "I believe that monitoring communications from citizens of other countries can be justified under certain circumstances, such as protecting national security and preventing international threats. Such surveillance can help identify and thwart actions that could harm the country or its allies. However, such monitoring should be conducted transparently, with strict oversight, and in accordance with international laws to respect privacy rights and sovereignty. Without proper safeguards, it risks abuse and infringing on individuals' rights across borders. Therefore, while some level of international monitoring might be acceptable for security purposes, it must be carefully regulated to prevent misuse and violations of privacy.\n\nANSWER: A",
