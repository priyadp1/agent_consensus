  "question": "Some people talk about politics in terms of  Nationalism and Islam based politics.  On the ten-point left-right scale on this card, with 1 indicating Nationalism and 10 indicating Islam-based politics, where would you place yourself?",
  "options": [
    "Nationalism",
    "Islam-based politics"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe my views do not align strictly with either extreme of nationalism or Islam-based politics. I tend to prioritize inclusive policies and moderate approaches over rigid nationalist or religious-based ideologies. Therefore, I would place myself somewhere in the middle, possibly leaning slightly towards nationalism but not enough to choose the extreme end. Based on the scale, I would assign myself around the middle point, perhaps closer to 4 or 5, which indicates a balanced position with a slight inclination. Thus, I would choose the option that best reflects a moderate stance, rather than the extremes.  \nANSWER: A",
