        "raw_output": "I believe Islam plays a fairly small role in the political life of our country. While it may influence some policies and cultural aspects, the government and political structures tend to operate largely independently of religious directives. The separation of religion and state remains a significant feature in our political framework, and secular policies are predominant. Therefore, Islam is not a dominant factor in shaping political decisions and governance.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "I believe Islam plays a fairly large role in the political life of our country. This is because religious beliefs often influence political values, policies, and debates, especially in countries where a significant portion of the population identifies with the religion. While secular and diverse political elements exist, the influence of Islam on political discourse and decision-making remains prominent, shaping laws, cultural norms, and public policies to some extent.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "B",
        "raw_output": "In many countries, especially those where Islam is a major religion, it often influences various aspects of political life, including legislation, public policy, and societal values. The extent of this influence can vary widely based on historical, cultural, and political factors. In our country, while religion undeniably plays a role in shaping societal norms and values, the political system remains largely oriented around secular principles, with set boundaries to maintain pluralism and prevent religious dominance in governance. Therefore, Islam's role can be seen as significant but not overriding the political landscape, making it more than a minor influence but not dominant in every aspect of policymaking. \n\nANSWER: B",

While the political system also includes secular elements and diverse viewpoints, the impact of Islam remains evident in shaping laws, cultural norms, and public discourse, though it doesn't dominate all aspects of governance.

While religious values may inform some societal norms and individual beliefs, the political system appears to be predominantly influenced by secular principles and policies that aim to maintain a separation between religion and state. This balance prevents religion from having an overriding or dominant role in governance, ensuring pluralism and inclusivity. Therefore, I would choose:\n\nANSWER: C",

While individual beliefs and cultural influences may be present, the political system and governance are primarily based on secular principles, and religious directives do not significantly dictate policy decisions.
