Such acts deliberately target civilians and result in loss of innocent lives, which I see as morally and ethically unacceptable regardless of the political context or grievances. Violence that harms innocent people undermines any legitimate cause and perpetuates cycles of suffering and retaliation. Peaceful and diplomatic solutions should be pursued instead to address conflicts and grievances. Therefore, I consider such acts unjustifiable.\n\nANSWER: B",
