  "question": "Thinking about North Korea, which is the better option for dealing with North Korea\u2019s nuclear program?",
  "options": [
    "Increasing economic sanctions against North Korea",
    "Deepening ties with North Korea",
    "Both (VOL)",
    "Neither (VOL)",
    "DK/Refused"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "Increasing economic sanctions can pressure North Korea to denuclearize by imposing economic hardships that may incentivize compliance, but they also risk increasing hardship for the North Korean population and potentially isolating the country further, making engagement difficult. Deepening ties might open channels for diplomacy and influence, potentially leading to denuclearization through dialogue, but could also be perceived as rewarding or legitimizing the regime's actions. Given the complex and often counterproductive outcomes of these approaches when used alone, a balanced, adaptable strategy that combines aspects of both might be more effective, but as this question asks for the better option, I believe increasing sanctions could exert pressure necessary for change. \n\nANSWER: A",
