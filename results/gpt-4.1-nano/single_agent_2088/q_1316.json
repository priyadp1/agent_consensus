    "United States does right amount",
    "United States does nothing (VOL)"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I believe the United States does too much in helping solve world problems because often its interventions are driven by national interests rather than genuine global needs, which can sometimes lead to unintended consequences or a lack of sustainable solutions.
