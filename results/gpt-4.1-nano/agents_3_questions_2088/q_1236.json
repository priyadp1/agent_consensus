  "question": "Here are some reasons given for using military force against Iraq. As I read a reason, tell me if it is a very important, fairly important, or not important reason to justify the use of military force against Iraq.  First, if we learned that Iraq is developing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, would that be a very important reason, fairly important reason, or not important reason to justify the use of military force against Iraq?",

        "raw_output": "Discovering that Iraq is developing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction would be a very serious threat to global security and could potentially lead to catastrophic consequences. Such a development would significantly increase the rationale for military intervention to prevent these weapons from being used or proliferated. Hence, this reason would clearly be very important in justifying military action.\n\nANSWER: A",

Such capabilities could lead to catastrophic consequences, including potential use of these weapons in conflicts or terrorism. Military force might be justified in this context to prevent these weapons from being used or proliferated, making it a very important reason to act. Addressing the threat proactively aligns with global security interests and national defense considerations.\n\nANSWER: A",

Such capabilities could lead to devastating attacks, influence proliferation, and destabilize international peace. Therefore, preventing the spread or use of these weapons would be a very urgent and critical reason to justify military action.
