  "options": [
    "More of a partner",

    "Neither"
  ],
  "answer": "C",
  "raw_output": "India's relationship with China is complex and multifaceted. While there are areas of cooperation, such as economic ties and regional diplomacy, there are also significant tensions related to border disputes, strategic competition, and differing geopolitical interests. Given this mixed dynamic, it is difficult to categorize India strictly as a partner or an enemy of China. Therefore, I see India as neither purely a partner nor an enemy, but rather as a nation navigating a nuanced relationship with China.\n\nANSWER: C"
