These factors have led to a perception that relations may have worsened, although not necessarily to the point of complete deterioration. Therefore, I believe they have gotten worse.\n\nANSWER: B",

There have been moments of increased cooperation and dialogue on certain issues, but also notable disagreements and tensions on others. Overall, I perceive that the relationship has remained relatively stable, with no clear trend toward significant improvement or deterioration.
