        "raw_output": "I would select C, not too much confidence, because Thabo Mbeki's tenure as South African President was marked by a focus on Africa\u2019s development and economic issues. While he demonstrated leadership domestically, his approach to international affairs, particularly regarding HIV/AIDS and regional conflicts, faced criticism for being cautious or inconsistent. This has led to a moderate level of confidence in his ability to handle global issues effectively, but not a strong or enthusiastic level of trust.\n\nANSWER: C",
