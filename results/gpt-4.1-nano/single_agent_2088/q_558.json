  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Since becoming president in 2013, Nicolas Maduro has largely continued many of Hugo Chavez's policies, emphasizing socialist ideals, strengthening ties with allies like Cuba and Russia, and maintaining a focus on social programs. However, there have also been shifts and differences, especially in economic management and handling of the opposition. Overall, Maduro's policy alignment with Chavez remains strong, but not identical in every aspect. I believe he has followed the policies somewhat closely, though not perfectly. \n\nANSWER: B"
