  "question": "Here are some different political and social actions that people can take. Please indicate, for each type of action, whether: you have done this in the past year, you have done this in the more distant past, you have not done this but might do it, or you have not done this and would never, under any circumstances, do it...participated in labor strikes?",
  "options": [
    "Have done in the past year",
    "Have done in the more distant past",
    "Have not done, but might do",
    "Have not done and would never do"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "raw_output": "I have not participated in a labor strike in the past year or any more distant past, nor do I have plans to do so in the future. I see strikes as a form of protest that can be effective but also disruptive and potentially harmful to others involved, including coworkers and customers. While I support workers' rights to advocate for better conditions, participating directly in a strike is not something I feel comfortable doing. Given the potential consequences and my personal beliefs, I would not participate under any circumstances.\n\nANSWER: D",
