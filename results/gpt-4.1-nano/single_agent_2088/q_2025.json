  "question": "If Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, do you think they would be likely to...attack the U.S. or European nations, or not?",
  "options": [
    "Yes, likely",
    "No, not likely"
  ],
  "answer": "B",
  "raw_output": "Developing nuclear weapons does not necessarily mean that a country will choose to attack others; it could be for deterrence or strategic purposes. Historically, Iran has not directly engaged in military conflicts with Western nations, and launching an attack with nuclear weapons might trigger severe international backlash and retaliation. Therefore, while the possibility exists in theory, the likelihood of Iran attacking the U.S. or European nations if they develop nuclear weapons seems low given their current strategic stance and the potential consequences. \n\nANSWER: B",
