There have been numerous reports of inadequate or insensitive investigations, delays, and sometimes even cases being dismissed or mishandled due to lack of proper prosecution or societal pressures. Ensuring stricter, more effective, and empathetic investigations could help in delivering justice and deterring future offenses.

        "raw_output": "India's police often face criticism for not being sufficiently proactive and stringent when investigating cases of rape. Many cases tend to be delayed, mishandled, or not thoroughly prosecuted, which can undermine justice for victims. On the other hand, accusations of police overreach are less commonly highlighted in this context. Overall, the perception leaning towards the need for stronger investigations suggests that the police are not tough enough in handling such sensitive and critical cases. Therefore, I believe that the police need to be more proactive, rigorous, and stringent in their investigative procedures related to rape cases to ensure justice and deter future crimes.\n\nANSWER: B",
