  "raw_output": "Political and parliamentary deadlock can significantly hinder a country's ability to pass necessary legislation, implement policies, and address urgent issues. When government branches are unable to work together, it often leads to stagnation, public frustration, and reduced confidence in institutions. Depending on the context, it can be a serious obstacle to effective governance. Therefore, I consider it a very big problem because resolving such deadlock is crucial for a country's progress and stability.\n\nANSWER: A",
