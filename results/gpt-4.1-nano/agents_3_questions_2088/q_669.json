        "raw_output": "The influence of the Prime Minister/President on the country's direction can vary significantly depending on their leadership style, policies, and the current political climate. If the leader has implemented effective policies that promote economic growth, social stability, and international respect, their influence could be viewed as very good. Conversely, if their actions have led to increased polarization, economic downturns, or social unrest, their influence might be seen as very bad. Given the current \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0631\u0648\u0641\u060c if I assess that the leadership has generally contributed positively to progress and stability, I would choose B. If their impact has been more negative, I might select C or D accordingly. \n\nANSWER: B",

If the leader has implemented effective policies that promote economic growth, social stability, and international reputation, their influence could be seen as very good. Conversely, if their governance has led to increased polarization, economic hardship, or weakening of institutions, the influence would be viewed as very bad. Based on current global trends and available information, the influence appears to be somewhat good, as the leadership is taking measures to address key issues but still faces significant challenges.\n\nANSWER: B",
