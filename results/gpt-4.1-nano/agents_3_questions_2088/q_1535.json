Supporters might argue that such measures are necessary for national security to prevent potential threats. Critics, however, often see this as discriminatory and harmful to America's values of inclusion and fairness, fostering fear and intolerance. Personal opinions on existing policies and broader views on immigration and security influence individual responses.
