        "raw_output": "Removing all duties that increase the price of goods imported from Germany would likely make imported products cheaper for consumers and businesses, promoting trade and economic efficiency. This could benefit both countries by increasing competition, lowering costs, and fostering stronger economic ties. However, some industry sectors concerned about fair competition or national interests might oppose such liberalization.
