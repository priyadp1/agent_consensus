        "raw_output": "I believe the United States is currently taking a fair amount of interest in Latin America. While the U.S. continues to monitor developments and engage with countries in the region, its focus is often divided among various international issues, and Latin America's importance tends to receive moderate attention relative to other priorities. The level of involvement seems significant but not overwhelming, reflecting ongoing diplomatic and economic interests without a primary strategic focus. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "I believe the United States is currently taking a fair amount of interest in what goes on in Latin America. While it is not overly focused or deeply engaged, there is enough attention given to regional issues, especially considering diplomatic, economic, and security interests. The U.S. has sometimes prioritized other global concerns, but it still maintains a notable level of involvement and awareness of Latin American affairs.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "raw_output": "In my opinion, the United States appears to be taking a fair amount of interest in what goes on in Latin America. While there are ongoing diplomatic efforts and engagement at various levels, the attention doesn't seem as intense or comprehensive as it once was during more heightened periods of geopolitical tension or regional crises. It feels like Latin America is somewhat on the periphery of American foreign policy priorities today, with some strategic and economic interests driving engagement but not necessarily a deep or constant focus. Therefore, I would say the level of interest is moderate but not overwhelming.\n\nANSWER: B",

While the attention is not as intense as during more turbulent times, the U.S. still maintains diplomatic, economic, and security engagements that suggest a moderate level of concern and involvement.
