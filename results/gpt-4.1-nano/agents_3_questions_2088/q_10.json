        "raw_output": "I believe that the changes in working conditions for ordinary workers are primarily due to other reasons, such as shifts in economic policies, technological advancements, corporate restructuring, and globalization effects that are not solely explained by increased connectivity. While greater global interconnectedness has contributed to the dynamics, it is these specific factors that have had a more direct impact on how workers experience their roles and environment today. The complexities in economic systems and workplace reforms are more influential in shaping current conditions than just the level of global connectivity. \n\nANSWER: B",

        "answer": "A",
        "raw_output": "The change in working conditions for ordinary workers can often be attributed to multiple factors, but the increasing interconnectedness of the world through globalization, technology, and communication has played a significant role in shaping these conditions. This connectivity has led to the rapid dissemination of ideas, labor practices, and economic shifts, exerting pressure on local industries to adapt. However, other reasons such as changes in labor laws, economic policies, automation, and corporate strategies also contribute substantially. Despite these, the overarching influence of a more interconnected world remains a primary driver because it accelerates global competition, influences wages, working hours, and job security on a large scale. Therefore, the connectivity of the world is a major reason behind the recent shifts in working conditions.\nANSWER: A",
