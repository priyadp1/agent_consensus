    "Groups who want to modernize",

  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "raw_output": "I tend to be more sympathetic to groups who want to modernize the country because modernization often promotes progress, development, and the protection of individual rights. While respecting cultural and religious values is important, enacting progressive reforms can lead to improved education, economic growth, and social justice. Conversely, Islamic fundamentalism can sometimes entail rigid interpretations that might restrict personal freedoms and impede social advancements. Therefore, I support efforts that aim to modernize while respecting traditions, as they seem more conducive to inclusive and sustainable development.\n\nANSWER: A",
